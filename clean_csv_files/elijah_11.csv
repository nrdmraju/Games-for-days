Two new, story-driven campaigns let you taste the explosive mix of the  jungle, Hueys and rock-n-roll in early 1968.  The US campaign focuses on a team of elite special ops soldiers, and  each one of them has a personality. The unit includes Sergeant John  Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade  launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some  missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act  together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops.  The North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military  consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only  survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting  back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one – they have no  means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it’s too far to  make it there on foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a  chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of  the well-known Tet offensive.  Missions range from special operations to full scale battles.

This heritage  has been celebrated in PES 2016’s new tagline ‘Love The Past, Play The Future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core PES values in last  year’s PES 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
PES 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘Best  Sports Game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘The Beautiful Game’. The series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present PES 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘The Pitch is Ours’ mantra. From  further integration of the industry leading Fox Engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of Master League, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
Fresh Gameplay – Exciting advancements reaffirming the PES series as having the No.1 gameplay.

Advanced Collision System – The physicality of the modern game has been realised in PES 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
Aerial Strength – With the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 Control – In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
Perfect Defence – Performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
Intelligent Player AI – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
Goal Keeper ID – In a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and  Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
Celebration Control – New for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

Fundamental Changes – New significant improvements across key modes and features.

New Master League – The famous and hugely popular  Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
New Visuals – Incorporating the many advancements  of the Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
Dynamic Weather – For the first time in the PES  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes  including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
Human Motion – Seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
New Ball Physics – The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

Quality Improvements – Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myClub – Since the launch of the mode in PES  2015, myClub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for PES 2016.  The enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. Use GP acquired through matches or myClub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. Choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. Build Your  Team, Create Your legacy!
Dynamic Wide Camera Angle – The new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to Intelligent Player AI. Depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
Commentary – New commentators have been  introduced for both UK and Germany, with Peter Drury and Marco Hagemann  joining the PES team. An abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for Master League, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
PS4 Image Importing – Edit mode is synonymous  with the PES series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. PS4 (and PS3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

PES 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the UEFA Champions League club competition, which was announced  recently. This new 3 year partnership allows KONAMI to feature both the  UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the UEFA Super Cup  featured within the iconic Master League mode.

""Akiba,"" for short.
This suburban Tokyo ward's seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
Enter, the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
AKIBA’S TRIP: Undead & Undressed tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

The classic 80's videogame star, Matt Hazard, is back in Eat Lead: The Return of Matt HazardTM.   Eat Lead sees Matt Hazard, voiced by Will Arnett (""30 Rock"" and ""Arrested Development""), get his chance to prove once and for all that he is the king of shooters when Wallace ""Wally"" Wellesley, new owner of mega game publisher Marathon Megasoft, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris (""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog""), gives Matt his comeback role starring in a new title for Xbox 360 and PS3.
In the world of Eat Lead, however, everything stops being a game and becomes reality when it is clear that Wally is using the new game to bring about Matt's death once and for all.  With only the mysterious ""QA"" to help him, Matt must fight against zombies, cowboys, space marines and more to keep his game from being over.
With an original storyline by 2008 Writers Guild of America Videogame Writing Award winner, Dave Ellis, Eat Lead's unique blend of comedy and action will provide gamers with a shooter experience like no other with hardcore gunfights intersperced with wickedly smart humour.
FEATURES

Comedic StorylineWritten by 2008      Writer's Guild Award winner, Dave Ellis, Eat Lead is a side-splitting ingenious storyline and setting      that's never been explored before in the shooter genre.  Both Will Arnett and Neil Patrick      Harris deliver perfectly timed punch lines that will make gamers laugh in      hilarity with their solid voice performance as Matt Hazard and Wallace      Wellesley.
Spoofed Retro      Characters Fight BackHelp classic videogame stars such as Master Chef and      Captain Carpenter redeem their dignity against enemy foes like Sting      Sniperscope and Sonny Tang and get to the bottom of why all these iconic      characters' worlds converge.
Intense Combat      ActionAttack enemies with everything from plasma rifles, to sniper      rifles, old-west six shooters and many other favourite weapons of choice,      or use a number of different interactive melee moves to help Matt destroy      Wally's legion of back-catalogue videogame characters.
Unique Level Design
An expansive      level environment design reflects years of videogame history in a next-gen      package including levels that are radically transformed via precisely      timed ""hack effects"" to challenge Matt Hazard with new scenarios      throughout each battle.
Strategic      Point-and-Cover SystemEat Lead uses a strategic      point and cover system that allows gamers to go far beyond simply hiding      behind walls when they can move up to, over, between, and around any cover      objects with a fluidity never before seen in a game.
Intelligent Physics SystemEat Lead makes use of the intelligent physics system that includes destructible items and smart objects, where items can be destroyed or moved to blow through cover or act as temporary safe havens throughout the game environment.

Sound the trumpets: the highly-anticipated PlayStation®Network title Fat Princess is bringing its comical medieval fun to PSP®(PlayStation®Portable), and with a host of added features.  Franticly-paced and strategic, Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake pits two hordes of players against each other in comic medieval battle royale on PSP.  The player’s goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle.  There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry.  Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield.
 
Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake, as players can switch between five different character classes literally at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy’s walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. 
 
The comical, quirky and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on PSP.  Now players can have their cake, and take it on the go, too.
 
KEY FEATURES
Six New Levels for PSP Plus All of the Originals – Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake adds six new battlefields to the franchise, including environments like Forest, Canyon and Volcano. 
Online Multiplayer – Go head-to-head with up to 8 players (4 vs. 4) via Ad Hoc (nearby) or Infrastructure (Internet connection) Mode.
Extended Single Player Campaign – Play through the extended Story Mode chapters on the go to learn the dramatic tale of the beloved fat princesses.
New Multiplayer Game Modes – New for Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake, select from four additional game multiplayer game modes, including Grim Ripper, Dilapidated, Demolition and Jailbreak.
Five Character Classes – Change your character class at any time merely by swapping hats: Worker, Warrior, Ranger, Mage and Priest.
Resources & Upgrades – Work together to collect resources to upgrade your weapons and castle defenses.
Customizable Avatars – Create your own personal avatar before you charge into battle.  Unlock new customization options during gameplay.

""Akiba,"" for short.
This suburban Tokyo ward's  seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic  bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress,  with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites,  it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence  would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
Enter,  the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the  town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and  cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of  their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming  veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
AKIBA’S TRIP: Undead & Undressed tells  the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who  was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and  transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the  worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter  named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an  organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi  and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save  Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

3 modes, up to 8 players, 16 ways to play, thousands of shapes!
In November 2011, a brand new way to play Twister is coming to Kinect for Xbox 360! Introducing... TwisterTMMania! This interactive digital Twister®experience allows up to eight players to twist into the action with 16 fun, unique ways to play in a TWISTER- inspired environment filled with iconic, colorful flair.
This outrageous fast-paced party game offers over-the-top hilarity - so don't hold back as you get your body moving and twisting to fit through cutouts, bend into thousands of forms, mirror your friend's image, and even clear stacked shapes lightning fast!  Play solo to earn the fastest time or team up in co-op for laugh-out-loud tangled-up fun with your family and friends. Twist into wild and crazy fun with TwisterTMMania!


Use 	your body as the game piece in this unique Kinect exclusive title 	that challenges you to twist yourself in thousands of different 	ways...even the menus react to your body!


Kick 	start the party by choosing from 3 main game modes:


Party 		Play: 		Twirl the virtual spinner and advance around the Twister®mat 		with up to four teams of two in Party 		Play, 		a metagame that combines all game challenges.


Play 		It All: 		Try your hand at every game challenge from start to finish in this 		campaign mode for the overachievers.


Quick 		Play: 		Jump right in and directly select any of the 16 ways to play and 		difficulty level for a quick challenge.




Twist, 	contort, duck and bend through four high-energy game challenges that 	each feature a range of four variations (total of 16 ways to play) 	to keep the action unique and challenging:


Shape 		Frenzy: 		Mimic the shape (there are over 1800!) that appears on screen and 		earn points based on how well you fill its silhouette.


Twist 		& Fit: 		Avoid the wall and fit your silhouette through cutouts coming at 		you on a moving wall. Score points by passing through a wall 		without touching a thing; the more wall you hit the lower your 		score.


Break 		It Down: 		Work your way through a stack of colored blocks by assuming their 		form. When a shape is removed, the wall above will begin to 		crumble.


Spot 		On: 		Challenge up to three players (or four teams of two) in a game of 		contortion H-O-R-S-E. Create a shape and see if your friends can 		match it.




Team 	up with another player for cooperative play or go head-to-head in 	any game mode. TwisterTMMania supports up to eight 	players in turn based pairs.


Relive 	hilarious, body-comedy moments with family and friends via photos 	after every play session.

Assassins Creed 2
Sequence 12 and 13!
3 bonus maps! Explore some of the Renaissance’s most prestigious monuments to reveal secret treasures in three special in-game maps: Palazzo Medici, Santa Maria Dei Frari, and the Arsenal Shipyard.

Assassin’s Creed® 2 is the follow-up to the title that became the fastest-selling new IP in video game history. The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance.
Assassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players.
Assassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin.

EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin.
RENAISSANCE ITALY Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder.
A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose.
DYNAMIC CROWD Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences.
BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.

The United States has a military presence in two thirds of countries around the world.
A group of 12 have had enough and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Sam Fisher is the leader of the newly formed 4th Echelon unit: a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Sam and his team must hunt down these terrorists by any means necessary, and stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero.
Operate Without Restrictions
Sam is back and deadlier than ever. He's the only secret operative with the power to act above the law, and uses ruthless methods to interrogate enemies in order to extract crucial information that will prevent the next Blacklist attack. Pursuing the terrorists to the far reaches of the world, Sam flies from exotic locales to US cities as he races against the clock to find out who’s behind the Blacklist. Thrilling gameplay is enhanced by full motion performance capture, creating a highly cinematic experience.                    
Unleash the Power of Fourth Echelon Prototypes
Infiltrate terrorist cells by using new gadgets such as the upgraded snake cam and micro tri-rotor drone which allows Sam to scout ahead, mark targets remotely, distract enemies, or explode with frag grenade force. Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is also bringing back fan-favorites like the sticky shocker, and for close quarters combat, players can wield the curved and brutal Karambit knife.
Build a New Echelon
With a mandate directly from the president, Sam is building a whole new Echelon unit; his team, his way. Anna “Grim” Grimsdottir is his technical operations manager, CIA operative Isaac Briggs brings additional firepower, and resident hacker Charlie Cole rounds out his support crew. Fourth Echelon is a fully mobile ops unit with unlimited resources and cutting-edge technology aboard the repurposed stealth airliner, the Paladin.
Enjoy a Fully Integrated Experience
Sam and his team are aware of terrorist attacks in real time thanks to the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI). The SMI allows the team to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can earn money for completing missions and objectives and buy upgraded weapons and items from the SMI hub aboard the Paladin.

Each character's unique attributes will be needed to complete your overall objective. Only with these skills working closely together, will you be able to say that you helped define the Hour of Victory™.




Fight your way with 3 playable characters: Choose from a Covert Operative specializing in stealth and sabotage, a British Commando specializing in the guns-blazing frontal assault, or an Army Ranger who specializes in sniping and demolitions.
Three enormous campaigns with multiple objectives: Play the North Africa, Black Forest, and Berlin campaigns. Each campaign has various objectives that the player can accomplish at his own pace and in his own style.
Steal it, drive it, shoot it: Any intact vehicle on the battlefield can be entered and driven, including the U.S. Army Jeep, Axis Kubelwagen, and even Sherman and Tiger tanks.
Deadly, authentic weapons: A full suite of Allied and Axis weaponry is available for the player to pick up and use.
Build your skills: Players become more proficient with different weapons and tactics the more they use them. The Covert Operative will get better at sneaking and using the knife, for example, while the Commando will improve with heavy weapons and at driving.

Taking on the role of Christopher Stone, players evolve from an average New Yorker into a fearless patriot who recruits and leads an army of freedom fighters in the streets of New York City. Freedom Fighters™ combines the depth of a squad-based game with the intensity of an action-packed war game that unfolds in the streets, subways, and buildings of the city.   With leadership comes great responsibility. The lives of your soldiers and the quest for American Freedom are held together by your courage, charisma, and leadership skills. Because wars are not won alone, a key component of the game depends on the player's ability to recruit and lead fellow New Yorkers in the battle against the Red Menace. An intuitive recruiting command system allows him to give orders to his fellow soldiers and execute critical missions at the touch of a single button.  Players will fight through the recognizable streets of NY with seamless urban fighting that takes place outside as well as indoors.  There are high rewards and penalties for wins and losses in Freedom Fighters. A charisma-based Recruiting System awards points for rescuing freedom fighters or capturing vital installations, allowing the player to recruit more men as well as providing an emotional tie to the fighters.   Your character and recruits engage the Red army with various types of single and two-handed weapons as well as unarmed combat martial arts maneuvers in their quest for freedom.

Each team takes it in turns to pick off the opposing teams using crazy weapons, tools and other utilities they may have discovered and whatever foul strategies they can conjure. 

Worms die when they lose all of their energy or plunge into the icy depths of the water surrounding the levels. The winning team is the one that manages to survive the mayhem and have worms left standing when the dust settles. "

The classic 80's videogame star, Matt Hazard, is back in Eat Lead: The Return of Matt HazardTM.   Eat Lead sees Matt Hazard, voiced by Will Arnett (""30 Rock"" and ""Arrested Development""), get his chance to prove once and for all that he is the king of shooters when Wallace ""Wally"" Wellesley, new owner of mega game publisher Marathon Megasoft, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris (""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog""), gives Matt his comeback role starring in a new title for Xbox 360 and PS3.
In the world of Eat Lead, however, everything stops being a game and becomes reality when it is clear that Wally is using the new game to bring about Matt's death once and for all.  With only the mysterious ""QA"" to help him, Matt must fight against zombies, cowboys, space marines and more to keep his game from being over.
With an original storyline by 2008 Writers Guild of America Videogame Writing Award winner, Dave Ellis, Eat Lead's unique blend of comedy and action will provide gamers with a shooter experience like no other with hardcore gunfights intersperced with wickedly smart humour.
FEATURES

Comedic Storyline Written by 2008      Writer's Guild Award winner, Dave Ellis, Eat Lead is a side-splitting ingenious storyline and setting that's never been explored before in the shooter genre.  Both Will Arnett and Neil Patrick Harris deliver perfectly timed punch lines that will make gamers laugh in hilarity with their solid voice performance as Matt Hazard and Wallace Wellesley.
Spoofed Retro      Characters Fight Back Help classic videogame stars such as Master Chef and Captain Carpenter redeem their dignity against enemy foes like Sting Sniperscope and Sonny Tang and get to the bottom of why all these iconic characters' worlds converge.
Intense Combat      Action Attack enemies with everything from plasma rifles, to sniper rifles, old-west six shooters and many other favourite weapons of choice, or use a number of different interactive melee moves to help Matt destroy Wally's legion of back-catalogue videogame characters.
Unique Level Design
An expansive level environment design reflects years of videogame history in a next-gen package including levels that are radically transformed via precisely timed ""hack effects"" to challenge Matt Hazard with new scenarios throughout each battle.
Strategic      Point-and-Cover System Eat Lead uses a strategic point and cover system that allows gamers to go far beyond simply hiding behind walls when they can move up to, over, between, and around any cover objects with a fluidity never before seen in a game.
Intelligent Physics System Eat Lead makes use of the intelligent physics system that includes destructible items and smart objects, where items can be destroyed or moved to blow through cover or act as temporary safe havens throughout the game environment.

This game tells the tales left untold by ""Samurai Warriors 4,"" and  from the point of view of the characters themselves, rather than the  previous title's focus on the various regions and clans of the time.  Drawing upon some of the new characters introduced in ""Samurai Warriors  4"" as well as other popular characters, this title depicts the stories  of these characters, enabling players to experience the untold stories  behind the drama of the era.
Naomasa Ii joins the fray as a playable character!

His story depicts his loyalty and devotion to the Tokugawa,  as well as his growth into a mighty warrior capable of matching the  mighty Tadakatsu Honda in battle. Watch his tale unfold as he supports  his adopted mother, Naotora Ii, and engages in battle with his rival,  Toyohisa Shimazu.
Survival Mode returns, bigger and better than ever!
After proving popular in the previous titles in which it has  appeared, Survival Mode returns with more features than ever before.  While the core concept of completing objectives as you ascend to the  castle's higher levels remains, a new, shorter way to play has also been  added, in which you must clear certain challenges in a limited time.  You must weigh the risks of continuing to progress through the castle  with the greater rewards that await you if you succeed.
All-new gameplay!
In addition to the exhilarating battlefield gameplay that the  series is known for, even more strategic elements have been added to  make the gameplay more tactical than ever before. From Hyper Attacks  being ineffective while in red zones to an increased emphasis on morale  and improved AI patterns for enemy soldiers and officers, a greater  focus on tactical gameplay has been added to all areas of the game.
Furthermore, the event scenes that are the backbone of the story,  along with the background environments, camerawork and effects have  increased the dramatic aspects of the game to allow for a story with  even more passion and depth.
New character development and collection aspects!
The character development system in the game has undergone numerous  changes, adding various weapons featuring different parameters,  elemental attributes, and rarity levels, as well as Skills that can  power up your characters.
You are also able to combine weapons and mounts in order to create  even more powerful versions for you to use in the quest to unite the  land.
These new features combine to let you develop your favorite characters in just the way you want.

Voodoo Vince™ is an outrageous venture—from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou—where you explore and fight as a tattered-but-tough voodoo doll on a quest to find the whereabouts of your keeper, Madam Charmaine.
In true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.
 
“An early nominee for best new character of 2003""—Official Xbox Magazine  “Voodoo Vince is surely on his way to becoming a big, bright, shining star …over the years we’ve played a lot of characters that do a lot of things, but none quite as cool as Voodoo Vince.”—Play Magazine  “The most striking aspect of Voodoo Vince is its unique world. Playful, with a touch of macabre, the game’s New Orleans (or ‘Nawlins’ as it’s properly pronounced) is oozing with personality.”—Gamespy  ""Stick a pin in me and call me Vince, this type of voodoo certainly has all the right elements that make for a good time at the old bayou.""—Eduardo Zacarias, GameZone.com 




Voodoo combat action: Employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, you actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase ""no pain, no gain.""
Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers.
Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete the quest.
Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.
Developer information: Beep Industries was founded in 2000 by creative director Clayton Kauzlaric, along with an impressive team of dedicated game industry veterans, including Director of Technology Matt Setzer, Art Director Gary Hanna, Executive Producer Barbara Hanna, Lead Programmer Kurt Pfeifer, Systems Architect Brian W. Brown and Business Manager Harald Kohl. The bulk of Beep's staff have worked together for nearly a decade. Based in Kirkland, Wash., the company was started with the goal of creating games and characters that fit the distinctive personality of its staff while maintaining uncompromising standards for art, technology and gameplay.

Featuring 50 Ferraris painstakingly modelled right down to the smallest detail, gamers are able to drive across every Ferrari Challenge series track with supreme handling, realistic AI and the most comprehensive custom vinyl editor ever offered in a racing title.  Features

Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli is the only video game to feature every track from the world renowned 430 series Ferrari Challenge. Every track has been recreated in painstaking detail, offering a racing experience closer to real life than ever before.
Recreating the experience of driving a Ferrari isn’t just about visual flair, but about how the car feels and sounds. System 3 has modelled each car in exquisite detail with engine and environmental audio recorded both internally and externally.
Once the race is over, watch television quality replays of the race from beginning to end. From behind the action, inside the wheel arch or overhead views, there is no competition for Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli’s replay system.
Driving the average car is nothing compared to the thrill and excitement of stepping behind the wheel of a Ferrari. Utilising some of the best development talent in the videogames and motorsport industries, System 3 has crafted a game that demands respect, and rewards it in return. With some of the most advanced handling physics achieved on each format, nothing will feel like a Ferrari before or after you sit behind the wheel in Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli.

With plenty of black humour and dark irony, this game immerses the player in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Your word is law as you become the all powerful Overlord, a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil after being raised from the dead.
The game's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures – the Minions. Accompanied by a horde of these slavishly loyal rascals, the Overlord plays dirty tricks on anything that moves to become even more powerful. The gremlin-like critters will follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.
The PS3 version of this game allows you to explore and conquer 5 extra supernatural realms. Defend the Overlord's tower against waves of enemy attack with seven additional online multiplayer maps, including the competitive 'Capture the Maiden' map and 'Protect Your Power'. The Challenge Pack also introduces a 'Legendary' mode, which challenges you by using your most aggressive minion managing skills to complete the single-player game under exceptional circumstances.

Choose from four different farms each with their own collections of animals: a traditional farm with pigs and ducks, an African ranch boasting lions and hippos, an Asian farm bursting with monkeys and elephants and a good old Australian ranch where crocodiles and kangaroos call the shots.
Choose your farm then start from humble beginnings: a single bird, an empty field and a few pennies. Buy food, clean, and care for your bird and watch him grow. When the eggs start coming, sell them to buy more animals which you can personalize and name as you like. Make sure you can feed them all though – if they can’t get food at home they’ll go elsewhere!
Once your livestock portfolio really starts to swell you’ll have more money to fix up the farm just how you always wanted it, with new fences, outbuildings and more. There’s bonuses along the way for good farming and clean healthy animals including other animals or special buildings such as windmills. Days pass, nights fall and the animals sleep, but you can bet they’ll wake up hungry the next day. Keep them well, and in time they’ll produce their own offspring, and hasn’t everyone always wanted their very own family of baby crocodiles or rhinos to care for?
My Farm Around The World lets players care for different animals from the four corners of the globe, breeding them, learning the simple economics of buying and selling, and growing their very own completely unique farm. And if you’ve ever wondered how an elephant would cope in a traditional European farmyard, trade animals with your friends via Wi-Fi and find out! "

However, after spending some time with Rocket, it reveals itself to be a deep, fun-filled adventure that really draws you in.Rocket begins in a typically cute and fuzzy fashion at a futuristic theme park on the eve of its opening day. The man in charge of the operation leaves our hero, a robotic unicycle, to tend to the park while the man is at home. And yes, something terrible happens. The vindictive mascot of the park, Jojo the Raccoon, escapes from his cage and rewires the whole park. So it's up to you, as Rocket the Robot Unicycle, to make things right again.Once you start to play and get a feel for the control, the game seems straightforward. But Rocket isn't your typical fast-paced platformer. Each level contains sublevel upon sublevel, not to mention minigames, puzzles, and lots of little things to interact with and figure out. For instance, early in the game you find out that one of the roller coasters is missing several screws. Once you chase down the screws within the level and bring them back to the attraction you must build a roller coaster that you'll actually get to ride. Building the track in the proper way will let you grab more items and bonuses. This hands-on problem-solving technique is really what sets the game apart from other platformers. Instead of just hitting button A to smash object B and collect item C, you must use your head along with a fair amount of control pad dexterity. The struggle and triumph of solving the problem is more of a reward than the actual object you are trying to collect.Visually, Rocket looks like a typical N64 platform game. The game has a very basic, colorful look. While Rocket himself looks good, the cast of generic characters you come across in the game are a little on the simple side. The whole production moves along at a smooth pace with a healthy frame rate. Of course, like most 3D platform games on the market, the camera isn't completely glitch-proof. There are occasions when the camera points directly at Rocket's face, leaving you blind as to what awaits you. The aural portion of Rocket is par for the N64 course. Happy, lighthearted tunes permeate the entire game, and the sound effects are cartoony in nature. In the end, Rocket is a good platform game that will please platform fans. Its gameplay is diverse yet solid, and it all combines to form a game that will keep you interested for quite some time. "

In addition, PS2 and Xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. With many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ECW arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
Gameplay:SvR08 enables you take control of your favourite WWE superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. Thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. Submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  AI will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  In order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. What direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
Features:

Superstar Fighting Styles: With eight Superstar Fighting Styles to choose from, playing WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 will never be the same. Each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. Take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the Superstars.
Struggle Submission System: The new Struggle Submission System gives players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars using the analog sticks. Realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ECW Presence: The life of a WWE Superstar isn't always pretty. ECW invades WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 with a variety of Superstars, arenas and weapons.
WWE 24/7 Mode: Combining the popular Season and General Manager Modes from previous Smackdown vs. Raw games, WWE 24/7 Mode embraces the intensity of the Superstar lifestyle. Multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a Legend.
Giving Fans What They Want: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

Uncover the chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft’s iconic universe.
The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.
Your mind will suffer - balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping shadows hide lurking figures… and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.

The game introduces two new playable characters, Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat, and is also one of the few Sonic games to officially feature Doctor Eggman as a playable character.
Gameplay: in Sonic Adventure 2 follows the same basic principles of previous games in the series. Along the stages are Rings, that as long as one is retained by the player, he will not lose a life when injured (except during the Miles ""Tails"" Prower and Doctor Eggman stages, in which the player has a health bar which is reloaded by gathering rings); and also items capsules which, when broken by the character, reward the player with one of a variety of bonuses. These include two different shields — one which simply protects the character from a single hit, and a magnetic one that attracts ring —, a ring bonus, an extra life, temporary invincibility (accompanied with a temporary change in music), a temporary speed boost and destroying nearby enemies. Each character has power-ups which grant them new abilities, such as destroying metal power-up boxes.
Plot: After discovering the existence of a secret weapon mentioned in the diary of his grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman infiltrates a high-security G.U.N. facility in search of it. This weapon turns out to be a black hedgehog named Shadow, the self-proclaimed world's ultimate life form. Shadow offers to help Eggman take over the world, and tells him to rendezvous with him at the abandoned Space Colony ARK with more Chaos Emeralds. Sonic is mistaken for Shadow by G.U.N. forces and apprehended, only momentarily evading capture to confront the black hedgehog, who perplexes him with his profound Chaos Emerald-empowered ability to use Chaos Control, which allows him to warp time and space.

The NFL Head Coach is the guy on the sidelines. Sometimes you see him hurl his headset to the ground in frustration. Sometimes he's pumping his fist in the air in triumph. Sometimes you see him screaming at a player, white-knuckled fist wrapped around the face guard, steam billowing out of his mouth in the frigid weather. Even when the teams win, he's never the MVP, and a player usually takes the credit at the press conference. Who hasn't wanted to be a football coach?
Head Coach lets you step into the shoes of all those famous football geniuses who have gone before. Manage a draft, hire staff, call plays, make trades, in the end, it's all your responsibility. This time, when the guy on field fumbles the ball, you really can blame him. You weren't the guy running. You just told him what to do.
Start from scratch and build a winning organization with talent, strategy and guile. Oh, and money. You'll probably need some of that, too. Build a reputation as a coach, and watch it fall and rise with your successes. Sit behind the desk, admiring your trophy case. Stand on the sideline, sweating bullets in sudden-death. Beat your players into shape. It's your job. You're an NFL Head Coach.
 

 

Build a team: Through drafts, free agency and trades, pick and choose your favorite players. Play to your strengths or eliminate your weaknesses by recruiting that one perfect player to bring everything together. Get them young and train them how you want, or shop around for the one skill your missing.
Supervise a staff: Recruit and hire a full staff of assistants, coordinators and coaches. They might make you look good, but if they screw up, it's all gonna be your fault. So choose carefully.
Call the shots: Build a playbook by creating new plays or adapting classics to your own style. Drill them into your players and roll them out in front of the competition. Go through every day of training camp drills, pre-season bumps, grueling practices, and triumphant games. This team looks to you to make every single call, and you'd better get it right.

This heritage  has been celebrated in PES 2016’s new tagline ‘Love The Past, Play The Future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core PES values in last  year’s PES 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
PES 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘Best  Sports Game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘The Beautiful Game’. The series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present PES 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘The Pitch is Ours’ mantra. From  further integration of the industry leading Fox Engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of Master League, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
Fresh Gameplay – Exciting advancements reaffirming the PES series as having the No.1 gameplay.

Advanced Collision System – The physicality of the modern game has been realised in PES 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
Aerial Strength – With the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 Control – In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
Perfect Defence – Performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
Intelligent Player AI – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
Goal Keeper ID – In a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and  Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
Celebration Control – New for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

Fundamental Changes – New significant improvements across key modes and features.

New Master League – The famous and hugely popular  Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
New Visuals – Incorporating the many advancements  of the Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
Dynamic Weather – For the first time in the PES  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes  including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
Human Motion – Seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
New Ball Physics – The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

Quality Improvements – Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myClub – Since the launch of the mode in PES  2015, myClub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for PES 2016.

Any mind, any time. For years, the Psychonauts have deployed their psychically-armed operatives all over the world, but this time trouble is brewing right in their own backyard. Someone is abducting students from the Psychonaut boot camp-a deranged scientist who only wants their brains. One cadet-a mysterious and powerful new arrival named Raz-stands alone against the lunatic. Raz must develop and unleash an arsenal of paranormal powers and his most powerful weapon of all-the ability to launch himself telepathically into someone else's mind, and run around in the demented amusement park of their imagination. Ultimately he must enter the mind of his worst enemy and destroy his dark plans at their source, while trying not to lose his sanity in the process.

Embark on a third-person psychic odyssey through thirteen incredibly unique levels: three set in the real world, and ten set inside the mental worlds of misfits, monsters and madmen  
Rise up in rank as you collect figments of other people's imaginations, sort their emotional baggage, clear out their mental cobwebs, and crack open their memory vaults  
Complete special training missions to learn the power of Levitation and the ability to focus Raz' mental energy into a powerful PSI-Blast  
Rank up to earn more psychic powers such as Telekinesis (toss enemies or objects with your mind), Invisibility (convince your foes they can't see you), Pyrokinesis (set the world on fire), Clairvoyance (see through the eyes of another), and Confusion (cloud the minds of your enemies, play tricks on your friends)  
Put your thoughts to use-Raz can grab the thought bubble over his head and pull it down around himself as a shield, hang from it like a hot air balloon, or jump on top of it and ride it around like a skateboard.  
Interact with a multitude of dynamic environmental features, such as tightropes, trapezes, ladders, poles, ledges, trampolines, climbing walls and rail slides.  
Non-linear gameplay with incredible depth offers players multiple paths and sub-challenges (digging up PSItanium arrowheads, finding lost brains, telekinetic canoeing, and winning the psychic scavenger hunt) so there is always a goal to accomplish  
Immersive story injected with lots of humor features vivid characters and a range of unique and wildly imaginative environments  
Challenging puzzles span a range of difficulty, with alternate solutions that self-tailor themselves to the player's own strengths and abilities  
Created by Tim Schafer, the visionary designer of award winning titles including Grim Fandango and Full Throttle

New gameplay mechanic:  Exceed Accel, a special type of Distortion Drive. Activating it allows  your character to perform a specific attack in their move-set, and once  it connects it dishes out large damage, but immediately ends Overdrive.
New gameplay mechanic:  Active Flow, which acts as the opposite of a Negative Penalty status. A  character that fights offensively goes into an Active Flow, which boosts  damage and recovery of the Burst Gauge. Active Flow also increases the  damage of Exceed Accel and for some it may add extra effects and  animations!

""Akiba,"" for short.
This suburban Tokyo ward's seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
Enter, the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
AKIBA’S TRIP: Undead & Undressed tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

Afterwards she was  confined to Rutledge Asylum, struggling to come to terms with her demons  by slipping into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years,  she has finally secured her release--yet she still bears the heavy  psychological burden of that tragic event.   In Alice: Madness  Returns, Alice is released from the asylum to a London psychiatrist’s  care. As nightmarish hallucinations continue to haunt her and invade her  reality, she seeks to understand her torment in order to recover  herself. Her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear and  neuroses prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Her  relocation to London seems only to add to their number and intensity.   Perhaps  she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there,  seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and  the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has  suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is  descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge.    Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both?

Based on the all-new CGI TMNT movie, Ubisoft’s TMNT™ video game takes place in New York City, a city plagued with fast-moving shadows and attacks from strange creatures. Could the wealthy and mysterious Max Winters be involved? New York City needs the Turtles now more than ever but they face their most trying time both as heroes and as brothers. With the fate of the City and their family at stake, it’s up to Leonardo with Zen Master Splinter to restore unity and ninja discipline to the Turtles. Join the Ninja Turtles team and experience unique acrobatic navigation, collaborative combat and powerful fighting moves. Engage in over-the-top Ninja action to reunite the Turtles and save New York City.
Features

Embody All Four Famous Turtles Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are playable, each with unique acrobatic moves, weapons and combat skills, such as Michelangelo’s fast nunchuk face slap and Raphael’s powerful Sai throw.
Extends the TMNT Movie Experience The video game uses the same dark and dangerous environments and same themes in the new TMNT movie. Will the Turtles be able to unite against the odds or will sibling rivalries create an unstoppable rift between the brothers? Only the player’s abilities can determine the outcome for the family.
Intense Ninja Fighting By harnessing the power of Ninjitsu, the four Turtles have become masters of combat. Leonardo shows a calm discipline when he faces his foes, attacking carefully and masterfully. Donatello’s bow staff can be used to reach distant enemies and as a pivot for him to swing himself around the arena. Michelangelo is a fast, flamboyant, energetic fighter, good for quick slashes with nearby enemies but for powerful direct attacks nothing beats the intensity of Raphael’s powerful Sai punches.
Unique Acrobatic Navigation The Turtles jump from rooftop to rooftop, scale tall buildings, dive into sewers and race through every corner of the city to confront their enemies. Using the Jade Engine (Prince of Persia franchise), Ubisoft’s acclaimed Montreal development team brings a unique fast-paced navigation element to the Turtles gameplay.
Powerful Tag Team Moves Together the Turtles can team up to reach locations unattainable alone, or use their unique individual abilities to find alternate routes and secret areas of New York City. By pairing up in combat, the Turtles can leverage their combined powers to create a multitude of devastating attacks to cripple the enemy.
Diverse Enemies and Bosses Characters from the movie and the original comic book series creep out of the shadows to face the Turtles. From the Purple Dragon Street Gang to the infamous Foot Clan, a new group of enemies lurks in the sewers. Find out what their plan is and how the Turtles can stop them.

Uncover a tale of espionage, intrigue, double-crossing and revenge in this action-packed, spy thriller-styled FPS.
Cold Winter's story has three distinct threads, played out over 13 suspense-drenched single-player missions. Sterling's quest for answers takes in a diverse variety of beautifully realised environments, from China and North Korea to India and Cairo.
The game's numerous enemies will use teamwork and strategic thinking to try and thwart your progress, laying down suppressing fire for one another and seeking cover at every opportunity. Successfully completing your mission will require you to use your head as well as your trigger finger. Cleverly, Cold Winter lets you collect and combine objects from your environment to create tools, weapons and traps.
Not recommended for younger or more squeamish players, Cold Winter uses a variety of effects such as ragdoll physics and vivid blood splatters for maximum gore factor.

It could have been much worse. Imagine if the U.S. and Russia hadn't come to agreements before September 2, before V-J Day. Bickering amongst the two powers could have tied up vital treaties. Germany and Italy are defeated, but politics would create their own new enemies. Emperor Hirohito would have been caught between two warring nations. Japan could never have surrendered on the eve of recurring hostilities. And World War II would never have ended.That's the concept behind Ring of Red, Konami's politically charged and potentially controversial PS2 strategy game. Japan is still battling back the occupied Allied forces within its borders since 1945. Taking an unsettling concept to fantastic levels of realism, decades of battle-scarred lands are rendered in breathtaking 3D vistas on Japan's islands. You are the underdog, the oppressed Japanese populace trying to scatter from underfoot of the two battling giants before the people are crushed under its weight. In this version of the war, evolved battle technology stems from the conditions, so WWII tanks have evolved into ferocious diesel-powered tank mechs seen in anime-inspired battles like Mobile Suit Gundam and Front Mission.

New attack moves deliver even more exhilarating action!
The immersive battles pitting a lone warrior against countless  swarms of enemies that the series is known for are back. New moves have  also been added, such as Hyper Attacks, which enable you to rapidly  close the distance between you and your enemy and swiftly dispatch them,  and Rage mode, which powers up your attacks when your Spirit Gauge is  full. Additionally, the character attack types and development system  have been overhauled, maintaining the ease of control that the series is  known for while introducing all new levels of depth to the fighting  system.
Travel across Japan with the new Chronicle Mode!
Journey across the lands of Japan while completing various  quests, meeting new officers and collecting items in the new Chronicle  Mode, which lets you explore the world of ""SAMURAI WARRIORS"" for  yourself. In addition, the Create Character feature has been vastly  upgraded, allowing you to create your own unique characters.

In the early 1980s, Atari took this abstract concept and turned it into one of the most addictive video games of its time. By moving a paddle from side to side to volley a ball back and forth, the object was to chip away at the wall in front of you one brick at a time. You would eventually progress to thicker, more complex walls, more capricious balls, and shrinking paddles until you finally lost your last rebound. 
Now on the PlayStation, Breakout sports a refined look but still has that simple, absorbing gameplay. You'll blast through bricks, blocks, barricades, and other bizarre barriers in both single and multiplayer modes--up to four players via the separately sold Multi Tap. This game also features a 3-D world with power-ups, new ball types, and interactive elements. Carom your ball off buildings and strange creatures to capture prizes and move through new levels.

Centring on the exploits of plucky teen Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) - college student by day, CIA über-spy by night - Alias is a sort of female version of James Bond, only with better wigs. We should also mention at this point that Sydney is actually a double-agent, working from the inside of the 'SD-6' division to bring down rogue operatives responsible for the assassination of her fiancé. Complicated stuff, we're sure you'll agree, but it'll all start to make sense once you get stuck in. Honest.
Taking up the controls as Intel-gathering agent with a grudge Sydney, you'll be assigned various missions which place emphasis on stealth rather than scrapping, and involve gadgetry and disguises galore. Never fear though, it wouldn't be Alias if there weren't any opportunities for high-kicking, karate-chopping combat situations to show-off your 'expert martial arts' moves in. Engage in hand-to-hand combat with multiple opponents, execute perfect roundhouses in the face of dodgy CIA operatives, and make use of everyday objects as weapons.
Comparisons with Splinter Cell and MGS will inevitably be drawn, but Alias' stealth-action mix has a unique 'split-screen camera' feature which distinguishes it slightly from the ever-burgeoning genre's pack. When Sydney is exploring her surroundings and attempting to locate her target (usually a vital piece of intelligence, such as a disk), the screen splits in two, with one side following Sidney, and the other providing a handy peek behind any upcoming obstacles. She also spends much of her time engaging in espionage, disguising herself as waitresses and wotnot to access top-level intel, and convincing goons to spill top-secret info to her. So, whilst there is plenty of action to keep attention deficit disorder sufferers pressing on, the emphasis is on keeping things low-key and using your nous to get through levels. "

This dramatic hockey simulation immerses gamers into one of the most realistic and exciting hockey experiences ever created. With more than 700 in-game, motion-captured animations, hockey fans will be able to take one-timers, blast slap shots, and dish out the big body checks, just like real NHL superstars. Gamers also can settle their hockey grudge matches and create their own rivalries online with Xbox Live and XSN Sports. Control an NHL team on a quest to win the Stanley Cup, or take on your friends in a single game between two bitter rivals.

Online play with Xbox Live: Go online using a broadband connection to take on your friends or the entire planet. NHL Rivals 2004 is part of the new XSN Sports line of games, which takes competition, attitude, and excitement to the next level. Create your own Web-based tournaments and leagues, view leaderboards, and communicate with other gamers through XSNSports.com.
Multiple game modes: With NHL Rivals 2004, you'll be able to play in Single Game, Season, Tournament, and Playoff formats. Plus, don't miss Instant Rivalry, which drops users instantly into a match between one of the NHL's most intense rivalries, such as the Maple Leafs and Canadiens.
Advanced Passing: Move left, pass right. Sound impossible? With Advanced Passing, you can pass the puck in any direction with the right thumbstick, while controlling your player's movement with the left thumbstick. Make no-look passes, drop it behind to your open winger, or chip one off the boards.
Pivot control: NHL Rivals 2004 gives you new ways to control your favorite players. Use the left trigger to change the direction your player is facing. If he's skating forward, he'll keep moving that direction, while spinning his body 180 degrees. Better maneuverability on offense and tighter, more effective backchecking on defense—what's not to love?
Heads-up coaching system: Change up your team's strategy on the fly with real-time commands. Need to buckle down to protect a late lead? Crash the net to tie things up? Whatever the situation, you can tweak your strategy to match … without pausing the action.
Veteran NHL announcers: You'll get insight and analysis during gameplay from the veteran broadcasting team of John Davidson and Sam Rosen, with injury and intermission reports from Dick Fain at rinkside.
Unbeatable sound: NHL Rivals 2004 brings you into the arena with full Dolby 5.1 support. Hear every slap shot, check, cheer, and heckle presented through the glory of true surround sound.
Content downloads: Get updated rosters and maybe a few mid-season surprises through content downloads via Xbox Live.
Crowds: You've never seen crowds like this in any game. NHL Rivals 2004 breaks new ground with dynamic truly three-dimensional crowds that react to every play. Full surround-sound recording sessions with real NHL game crowds will bring the roar of the fans right to your living room.
Unique player roles: See your favorite NHL stars play the way you expect. Enforcers deliver crushing can-opener hits; agitators get in the face of would-be shooters; and snipers spin and fake shots on their way to the net. Learn the special moves for each role, and take your game to the next level.
Authentic NHL gameplay: Pin opposing players against the boards, go down to block shots, and wind up for one-timers on loose pucks. Use your stick to disrupt plays—you can even execute diving poke checks when things get desperate. NHL Rivals 2004 delivers the moves hockey fans have always wanted.

In your perilous journey, you must collect weapons and magical powers to defeat increasingly formidable foes.


Throughout the game you will encounter four action-packed worlds that include: The Human World, Peripheral Realms, Sia's Kingdom, and the T'soa Empire. Each world contains five separate levels of challenging play, plus two bonus levels where you face your archenemy, Onimen. Along the way, Onimen's evil minions, the Tigermen, Pelicanmen, and Waspmen, keep you on your toes while the ferocious Weaselwomen and Chameleonmen lie in wait. "
