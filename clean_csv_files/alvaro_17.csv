Familiar chess pieces are brought to life as richly detailed 3D models, with players seeing the spectacular results of their actions in their quest for domination of the board.

The traditional white and black armies have evolved into an army of light with their brave knights in shining armor, pitted against the wicked dark army of demons and beastly golems. Each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war. If a square is occupied by an enemy unit, they enter into a brutal clash that sees the foe removed from the board in bloody combat.

Another evolutionary element Battle vs. Chess brings to the arena is the addition of the optional Action Mode. If selected, instead of entering a scripted animation when attacking, players challenge their opponent in a beat-'em-up style encounter. Using a variety of weapons, fighting techniques and combos, players must best their opponent in a fast-paced flurry of blows and special moves –adding a whole new meaning to the phrase checkmate. "

The Town of Light
12 March 1938. Renée, 16 years old, is ripped out of her world, locked up and deprived of everything. Her only fault was that she didn't know what her place in the world was. ""A danger to herself and others and a cause of public scandal"" wrote the police headquarters. The only horror you will find in this game is the truth: a blow to the solar plexus, much more intense than any supernatural presence
The Town of Light is a psychological adventure told in the first person. The story is set in Italy in the first half of the 20th Century in a place which really existed and has been meticulously reconstructed. Exploring and interacting with the environment you will relive the history of the main character through her confused viewpoint and on the basis of your choices, the story will develop in different ways.

Earth is an inhospitable place for a little blue alien. Thankfully Cosmi is armed with the latest gizmo for covert infiltration: a Capture Gun. With this nifty little piece of kit he can scan the DNA of humans and assume their form by using one of the UFO transformation points. Possessing different forms also opens up different tricks with which to make mischief.
Tricks range from the obvious (dropping tacks on the street), to the absurd (tone-deaf singing), but their purpose is always the same: to make the earthlings drop coins for you to collect and prove your mastery of mischief.

In an abyss of infinite chaos,
God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Ballet  tells a story, expressed through music and dance instead of words. In  this new simulation for Wii and Nintendo DS, players take on the role of  a 12-year-old girl, who has just been admitted to a very prestigious  dancing academy. During her period of training, the heroine commits  herself solely to dancing. Her dream is to become a great prima  ballerina. But the path to success is full of challenges. Also, she  should never underestimate her fellow students, because some of them  would do anything to outdo their competition. But only the best will get  a chance to shine, and therefore players will have to keep proving and  improving their skills. Luckily, they are getting support from Nathan, a  young, very talented dancer, the heartthrob of every girl in the  academy. Together, they train between lessons, so that the heroine can  make her dream come true and become a famous prima ballerina.   ""Repetto Presents Ballerina"" is set in the academy, as well as an opera  house. The single player title offers awesome dance animations, gorgeous  2D and 3D graphics, and a gripping story filled with passion and  adventure. Just as in real life, hard training is a main factor. At the  same time, the game tries to convey values such as friendship, loyalty,  and helpfulness. The Wii version features six prominent ballets that can  be performed using the Wii Balance Board™ and the Wii Remote.

This man had dispatched assassins to bring down Duke, the leader of ""Mephistopheles,"" an up-and-coming gang in the area...  But the attempt ended in failure, and in return, the life of the assassination attempt's perpetrator was forfeited. To the poor and downtrodden, he was their savior...and his name was Fate.

They owe a debt of gratitude to Fate, who looked after these two when they were kids.  Alba happened to be present at the assassination of Duke, which triggered subsequent incidents. Consequently, Alba was regarded as a traitor, but Alba's younger brother and his fellow gang members work to clear his name.  -THE PRESENT- With the death of Fate, the balance of power has tipped and all gangs await the opportunity to rule the underworld.  To restore order to the chaotic downtown scene, Alba attempts to contact Duke. Hyena, assuming the role of mediator, relays the conditions for a meeting with Duke.  The sole condition: ""If you want a meeting, first you must battle and defeat all those whom I designate.""  Alba swallows this cynical circumstance so that he himself may bring things to a conclusion with Duke.  Meanwhile, Soiree swings into action. In order for his older brother Alba to assume leadership downtown, Soiree sees it necessary to defeat Duke.   Features

Metroid Prime is a first-person adventure game. Players control a bounty  hunter named Samus Aran who must unravel a mystery behind the ruined  walls scattered across Tallon IV.
The game opens just as Samus' spaceship docks on a Space Pirate vessel  orbiting the planet. Immediately, the beautiful graphics slap you across  the face. Trust us, it's a firm slap. A silky-smooth framerate  accommodates razor-sharp visuals of efficient machinery and foreign  architecture. Meanwhile, a cinematic soundtrack sets the mood and eerie  sound effects thicken the alien atmosphere.
By far, the most effective visual effect is that everything you see is  viewed through Samus's visor. The entire screen has a convex look, and a  digital display provides information ranging from current energy levels  to ammunition data. The most effective ideas are sometimes the most  simple, and the visor view in Metroid Prime makes a huge leap forward in  immersing players in the first-person perspective.
Samus uses a Power Beam to shoot a series of locked switches, and  eventually enters a cylindrical corridor very similar to the passageways  found in the original Metroid titles. When Samus strides by broken  pipes spewing steam, the visor becomes smeared with condensation. Later  in the demo, the visor is splattered with the internal juices of  ruptured enemy carcasses. Yes, life within Samus' gravity suit is a  beautiful thing.
Weapon effects are equally pleasing. Hold the A Button to juice up the  Charge Beam, and you see the corridor glow and warp as the blast travels  through space. Enemy animation is delightfully disgusting, whether it's  a giant parasite queen squirming from the ceiling or a swarm of  blood-thirsty critters gushing from a dark hole. Take note: the word  ""swarm"" has been misused in video game reviews for years. With Metroid  Prime, we can use the word ""swarm"" and feel perfectly justified. The  screen fills -- FILLS -- with baddies, and the framerate doesn't even  blink.
In the Gravity Suit
Of course, graphics are just the glossing on the gravity suit. No matter  how good a game looks, it won't get fired up more than once without  solid game design and user-friendly play control. In Metroid Prime, both  are spot-on.
How do you know if play control is good? If you don't think about it,  it's perfect. Once you get a feel for the Controller configuration in  Metroid Prime, you spend 100% of your time worrying about blasting  enemies -- not thinking about the play control.
The Control Stick moves Samus around, the A Button fires weapons and the  B Button makes Samus jump. Press and hold the R Button to enter an  aiming mode which allows you to freely look around the environment. The L  Button activates an automatic lock-on feature, which makes for easy  strafing while firing at a targeted enemy.
Changing weapons is as easy as moving the C-Stick. By pressing different  directions on the D-Pad, you can activate the different features of  Samus' visor. A variety of visor modes are available including Combat,  Scan, Thermal and more. Combat is the normal view, and Scan produces a  slightly magnified rectangular viewing strip in the middle of the visor.  By pressing and holding the L Button, Samus can scan various items in  the environment. Sometimes a scan simply provides additional  information, and other times scanning an environmental element can  activate a switch or identify and enemy's weak spot.
Pressing the Y Button activates Samus's missiles, and the X Button  engages the Morph Ball. The game switches to a third-person perspective  while Samus is in Morph Ball form. In Morph Ball form, Samus can roll  through tight quarters, place bombs, activate switches and much more.
Exploration is Key
When Samus lands on Tallon IV to begin her investigation of Space Pirate  activity, the bounty hunter is stripped of most power-ups. It's up to  you to explore the world and recover the many power-ups and weapons  which gradually open more and more gameplay areas.
Although this is a first-person game with plenty of shooting action, the  heart of the experience is highly exploratory and adventurous. Enemies  abound, but there are just as many elaborate puzzles to solve as there  are bad guys to blast.
For an immersive adventure unlike anything you've played before, get  behind the visor and see what's it like to be Samus Aran in Metroid  Prime.

It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.

Nobody knows who built it, or when it was built.
Some say it holds treasures that could control the world, treasures that could make one immortal, and a slumbering demon king whose awakening could end the world. But no one knows for certain. What is known is that the labyrinth is filled with cursed miasma, a substance that brings death to any human it touches.
One day, a witch arrived at Refrain with the intention of exploring this labyrinth. Her name was Dusk Witch Dronya. She had in her possession a legendary book, said to have been written by the only man to explore the labyrinth and survive. The Tractatus de Monstrum...
Systems

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf. Since you are just a mere book, you must rely on the many puppet soldiers that you can bring into the labyrinth to fight for you. Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole. Battles consist of multiple covens attacking and defending themselves from enemies.

In the dark days of the end of World War Two amidst the ruins of Berlin, one bullet can change history…

Sniper Elite V2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the  highly-acclaimed Sniper Elite, giving gamers the most authentic World  War II sniping experience available. You are elite US sniper Karl  Fairburne. Parachuted into Berlin amidst the Germans’ final stand, your  mission is to prevent Nazi V2 rocket program technology from falling  into the hands of the besieging Red Army. You must aid key scientists  keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the  Russians.
Take advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your  targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill,  patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the  key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race  against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite  returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are  rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are  graphically rendered in X-ray as the bullet enters and destroys your  victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact  of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.
As World War II ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts. Use it wisely.

Pharaonic is an unforgiving sidescrolling Action-RPG set in Ancient Egypt. Explore a vast kingdom full of dangers and brutal enemies while you find the truth behind Ahmosis I, the Red Pharaoh.
Polish your combat skills to the finest and loot the best gear  possible to even have the slightest chance of overcoming this difficult  endeavor. Will you opt for lightweight equipment, trusting on your  agility to avoid death? Or will you prefer to take the blow and strike  back even harder? The decision is entirely yours to make.
Throughout your path you will find help from the Daughters of Ishtar,  as well as the oppresed countrymen. Learn new skills and subdue divine  powers to overcome your opponents. Drink from your life-water canteen to  heal your wounds, and acquire new equipment that will help you avoid  death one more day.
It’s a tough journey, but the Gods believe in you. Will you be worthy of that honor?
Pharaonic takes the excellent combat design of Dark Souls and adapts  it to a faster paced side-scrolling environment.

A single mistake can be fatal,  so stay on your toes to avoid making any.

Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

Throughout the game players will actively control a horde of these gremlin-like critters and they’ll follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the Minions, life threatening it is.

The games are interesting combinations of science-fiction storylines and history. In COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT, for example, players find themselves in an alternate history where the allied forces are battling Stalin and a powerful Russia instead of Germany because, after inventing a time machine, Einstein killed Hitler. It's interesting storylines like this that make the series so much more than the typical RTS game. Twelve different COMMAND & CONQUER games are included in THE FIRST DECADE package, including the original game, RED ALERT, TIBERIAN SUN, RENEGADE (a first-person shooter set in the C&C universe), RED ALERT 2, YURI'S REVENGE, C&C GENERALS, ZERO HOUR, and more. All have been updated to run on Windows XP. All of the games take different approaches and are often set in different worlds, although some are direct sequels. However, the well-written storylines and addictive gameplay remain the same through each game, with each successive game tweaking the mechanics a bit. Players will find the first C&C game does play a bit differently than the more recent ones, but the controls aren't so outdated as to make the game no longer fun. Fans of the COMMAND & CONQUER series who missed a few installments should pick up the COMMAND & CONQUER THE FIRST DECADE pack. "

SAW is a third-person perspective, survival horror game based on the SAW film franchise, which has grossed more than $665M worldwide and sold more than 28 million DVDs.  The game features many of the deadly mechanical traps seen in the film, as well as terrifying new ones.  Players will pit their wits against Jigsaw as they navigate his world in an attempt to evade and escape his gruesome traps, while also struggling against his minions in brutal combat by using weapons found within the environment.
SAW, the video game, is based on a treatment from Zombie Studios and the creators of the SAW franchise, Leigh Whannell and James Wan.
The timeline for the game takes place between the movies: SAW and SAW II, giving the game its own story, yet fitting within the narratives of the movies.
The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw.  Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp's mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp's career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw's traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game-the likes of which he has been investigating for years-to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others. But each victim has a dark connection to Tapp. Will Tapp save them? Can he survive his obsession to find the Jigsaw killer?
Product Features

Traps of Lethal CunningJigsaw has laid out a gauntlet of torturous traps for a handful of innocents. Only you stand between them and the most brutal death imaginable. Think quickly and act! The clock is ticking.
Choices of ConscienceThe player is forced to make difficult moral choices. Who lives and who dies in the game is determined by the player's choices.
Mysteries RevealedUnanswered questions from the films are finally laid to rest. Gamers will discover the origin of Jigsaw and why he devoted his life to games, while also finding out what happened to the characters from the first SAW movie.
An Ecology of TerrorThe asylum in which Jigsaw has trapped you is abandoned, but it is far from empty. It is a living world of horror populated by Jigsaw's minions and the insane souls they torture... and they have no intention of letting you leave.

Game Features

 THE ROAD TO THE WRC:  															Live the life of a real rally driver through the career  mode of WRC 2.

Among the brand new features this year, you can create  your own team and manage them during your ascent to the WRC. Find the  best mechanics on the market to maximize the performance of your car,  hire skilled managers to unlock profitable sponsorships ... and strive  to earn a contract with one of the WRC teams.  Are you ready to become the new champion of the world? 

 SINGLE PLAYER MODE: In addition to  the Single Stage, Single Rally and Championship, amongst the classic and  established game modes .The new WRC Rally School has been improved in  order to teach you the basics of the guide and to refine the techniques  used by champions. In WRC2 now you can additionally take on the famous  Super Special Stages, in which two cars compete at a time on  two-parallel-lanes tracks. 

 HOT SEAT: In the Hot Seat mode, up  to 4 friends can challenge each other on a Single Stage, a Single Rally  or an entire Championship, playing one after the other. Who be the local  champion 

 ONLINE: Play online with friends,  challenging them in the Single Stage, Single Rally or Championship. Your  results will affect your ranking online as you try to become the best  rally driver in the world. This year, the Super Special Stage mode will  also be available online... so you can challenge opponents in a 1on1  competition with updated online rankings, that will show the best  ""duelists"" in the world 

 PHOTO MODE: Starting also this year  players can capture the most exciting moments of  races, through the  new photo mode. Just put the game on pause, frame the car and shoot.   Then if you really want to show off apply some of the many special  visual effects. 

 REWIND EFFECT: Didn't take the  corner quite right, no problem?  With this new game feature you can  rewind time and return a few seconds before it all went wrong. The  feature also helps inexperienced drivers master new tracks 

Improvements

 CO-DRIVER: With a passion to make this the  most authentic rally experience. The team at WRC2 took direction from  professional co-drivers so the in-game notes have been improved in every  rally, increasing the levels of information and making the timing of  co-driver instructions as accurate as possible. 

 REAL SOUNDS: Bring the roar of the engines of the WRC cars into your living room!  					Thanks to the many different recording sessions performed in  the field, the in-game sounds of cars have been made even more faithful  to the real ones! 

 GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of each Special Stage  has been improved thanks to meticulous attention to detail making the  streets even more faithful to those of the World Rally Championship.  This year you will face tight hairpin turns, rough terrains, winding  curves and sudden changes to the surface conditions 

 COCKPIT VIEW: The cockpit view has been  further enhanced with the introduction of the ""look to apex."" During a  hairpin nothing can escape you. In fact, the view automatically pans  towards the path you're driving, simulating the movements of the head of  a real driver, further enhancing the feeling of realism 

 GRAPHICS AND LIGHTNING: Graphics and  environmental lighting are now showing more vivid colors, making all the  tracks more real and realistic. The environment is rich in vegetation,  which produces some wonderful effects of light and shadow. The  introduction of the ""haze"" effect also enhances the scenery. 

 REAL ENVIRONMENT: Powerful vehicles, crumbling  roads, changing conditions ... the new driving experience will allow  you to immerse yourself in the world of rally as if you were really  behind the wheel of a 300 BHP vehicle, on off-road trails, on any kind  of surface. 

 PHYSICS AND DAMAGES: In WRC 2 we have  technically improved the physics. Now the car behaves even more  realistically thanks to a new suspension management system that allows  the car to be more responsive to the undulation of the surface. 			The driving experience is much more fun, realistic and enjoyable.  And we also introduced new graphics for damage thanks to an enhanced  system that allows more realistic and detailed deformation following  collisions.

Two warring factions arise from the rubble: the Echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the Sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time.Units Descriptions
Echelon

EnforcersEnforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the Echelon. Determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, Enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the Chancellor. They are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

Grenades: The Enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
Riot Shield Up: The Enforcers activate their energy Riot Shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


InfiltratorsThe arbiters of justice, Infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the Echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. Trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the Echelon infantry, Infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. All Infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. The Infiltrator always strikes its target.

Thermal Vision: The Infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


ProwlersProwlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. Unmatched for their versatility, Prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. Echelon Commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

Search the Skies AA Mode: The Prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



Sai

RangersRangers perform two functions within the Sai hierarchy. Firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting Sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, Rangers form into Militia Platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to Sai commanders. Armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, Rangers are best deployed in numbers. When the Rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. They can also fire Sai energy charges at air targets.

Sai Anti Air Rockets: The Rangers can fire Sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
Commando Rush: The Rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


SpectresThe silent knives in the night, Spectres are a true nightmare for Echelon soldiers to handle. They have an exceptional ability to control Sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. Able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the Spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. The Spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. The fact that Spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

Mind Control: The powerful mind of the Spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
Cloak: The Spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. The shimmering can be detected from up close though.
Rapid Slice: The Spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


ScorpionsThe Sai may not be as technologically advanced as the Echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. Scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around Sai villages and to provide light strike power for when Sai forces go into combat. The Rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

But an unholy pact with a demon unknowingly puts you square in the middle of a fight for control of the underworld... with the future of humanity hanging in the balance.

Intense gameplay: The player will be constantly outnumbered, fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds. 
Next-generation graphics: The game uses a proprietary 3D engine capable of pumping out 100X the polygons of some of the latest shooters, while adding increased texture quality and the latest lighting and shadowing techniques. 
Lasting replay value: Painkiller features a standard single player campaign, with additional modes to encourage replay. The game also features full multiplayer support.
Combo weapons: All weapons come in pairs, with a primary and secondary fire.
Morphing: Your unholy pact gives you the power to morph into a powerful possessed creature with every 100 souls collected.
Monster AI: Advanced AI coding will simulate group behaviours. Monsters don't spawn onto the map, they patrol. They are constantly aware of the player, and will coordinate their attacks by retreating, regrouping and counterattacking.
Physics Engine: Painkiller employs the Havok physics engine, allowing for inverse kinematics (""rag-doll physics"") and deformable, interactive environments

The Raoh story  arc has been completely reimagined, while the Celestial Emperor and Land  of Shura story arcs have been added as well. Whether you are familiar  with the source material or not, the story is more complete and more  enjoyable than ever before. By playing as different characters throughout each episode of the  story, you will be fully immersed in the Fist of the North Star world.  With features like boss battles faithfully recreating scenes from the  manga, series fans have plenty to be excited about.
In addition to a more faithful recreation of the story, a large number  of characters are added to the game series as well. In addition to the  playable characters from the previous game, those that appeared only as  NPCs such as Juza and Shew are now playable. In total, there will be  more than twice as many playable characters as the previous title. Popular characters from the new storylines such as Falco and Kaioh  will also appear, making for an even greater variety of characters to  control.
The ability of the successors of Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Seiken to kill  opponents in a single blow has been merged with Warriors-style  gameplay. This time, there will be even more exhilarating action than ever  before. In addition to the various techniques, taunts and special moves  of the previous game, new moves such as dodges and dashes will be added  as well. Experience life as a martial arts master as you predict an  enemy's attack and close the distance to finish him off before he can  even land a single punch.
The popular Dream Mode featuring original stories based on the characters has been completely revamped. Focused on the original manga, these stories will fill in the  gaps around the stages of the Legend Mode. Even characters that did not  get much coverage in the original manga will be given their time in the  spotlight, allowing you to enjoy plenty of hypothetical stories unique  to Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage 2.
This title features online co-op and versus play within Dream Mode. In versus play, players form teams and compete against the  other in a variety of missions, with the winners obtaining unique  bonuses. The character costume DLC that was so popular in the first game  also returns, and there are plans to make new stages available for  download in Dream Mode as well.

Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

Sometimes, Evil Wins
In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.   Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.
Main Features

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious.  Choices matter – make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?  Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation.  A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil.

It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.

You can establish your club as the small team who receives loan players from a larger club or a large club looking for support getting your youngsters match experience by loaning them out. Have the first option on players from clubs, and schedule pre-arranged friendlies each season by simply asking your board for a feeder relationship and choose from the list they compile. Youth Revamp - A complete revamp of youth teams sees full youth squads for each team that has a youth set-up, thus giving a much better system for the regeneration of players in the long term game. Football Manager 2007 gives players a new easier to use default skin, along with hints and tips throughout the game, and an improved tutorial. In addition to better feedback from your assistant manager and scouts as well as lots more media, customisation and multiple row selection, all this adds up to the most user friendly Sports Interactive game ever. A complete revamp of the scouting system inside the game leads to more information about players and teams being made available to managers, as well as a more realistic methodology for player scouting. This system allows scouts to grow and improve their knowledge-base of the world's football players. You can now talk to any player in the world via the media. Player interaction allows you to tap up other teams stars or see if players will buckle under the pressure. An effective manager must use the media as a motivational tool - why not praise your own players in many different ways or shout at them for loss of form? For more varied ways to talk to your team, SI have worked hard to deliver vastly improved team talks at half and full time. Not only this, but pre-match team talks will now be making their first appearance in Football Manager - so you can send your team out onto the pitch with a specific briefing.

He is found and adopted. As he grows, he learns of his true identity and destiny of greatness.Thus is the premise of two of the greatest stories of our time, but that is where the similarities end. Now we’re not saying that “Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn” is better than the Good Book; that would be blasphemy. But please consider the following questions: • Does the Bible feature BASKETBALL LEGEND SHAQUILLE O’NEAL AS AN ASS-KICKING WU XING MASTER?• Can the Holy Writ boast A DOPE NEW RAP FEATURING THE BIG ARISTOTLE HIMSELF?• Does the Book of Books provide the EXCITEMENT AND HILARITY OF BATTLING BOSSES WHO ARE PARODIES OF FAMOUS DOUCHEBAGS?• Do any of the conflicts depicted in the The Sacred Testimony qualify as EPIC BOSS BATTLES THAT YOU WON’T BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY PUT INTO A GAME? “Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn” DOES contain all of those thrilling features and many more!
