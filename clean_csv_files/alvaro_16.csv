Vice City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, and was the most varied and complete digital city created at its time. Combining nonlinear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with seedy opportunities and are given the chance to take it over as you choose. Take control of a variety of vehicles including high-performance cars and motorbikes, powerboats, golf buggies and helicopters. No matter what type of man you are, Vice City is always full of surprises.
Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch inside, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hodonistic metropolis of Vice City. Tommy is set up and loses everything. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead.

The time of prophecy has arrived. Evil is afoot and the villainous Master Gardal has diabolical plans. With the aid of his faithful minions Quiph and Morg, he intends to conquer the famed Castle of Heaven, the supreme fortress built to protect the world from the forces of darkness.
The only way for Gardal to breach the castle gates is by using the pure, untainted soul of Erwyn, a young boy mentioned in a millennia-old prophecy. Yet Gardal didn't count on the help of Aira, Erwyn's clairvoyant sister.
To save her brother, Aira has sealed Erwyn's soul within a single teardrop and transformed this into a protective orb. Now, in order to free her brother, she must safely guide the orb into the Castle of Heaven using a magical beam of light.
Avoid the traps, whilst solving puzzles and riddles designed to slow you down, as you take control of the beam of light to guide the orb through an intriguing world of danger and adventure.

Dive into the futuristic cyber-world of the Cy Girls, an all-new action thriller starring the sexiest duo in video games, Ice and Aska. Combining strength and style, this pair of spydivas takes on the nastiest of cyber-terrorists in a world where the real and the virtual coexist. Using their beauty, brains and brawn, these hot new heroines deliver twice the action!
Inspired by the Takara® range of action figures, Cy Girls is a breath-taking tale of information terrorism, computer hacking and martial arts. Starring Cy Girls agents Ice and Aska, the game spans two DVDs charting the pairs' missions, as the player is drawn into a deadly mission of espionage and adventure. The two DVDs are linked by a common story and, as the pair travel the globe in separate missions to track down and eliminate a computer wizard out to hold the world to ransom.
Each girl specialises in a particular form of combat, with Ice being the master of firearms and projectile weapons, while Aska is a master Ninja and thus trained for close weapon or hand-to-hand combat being more athletic in her approach. This is perfectly demonstrated via the game's unique eight-directional control system which allows Aska to run along walls, while both characters can perform crouching attacks and roll and loose off weapons in one fluid movement.

You will lead a band of heroes on a perilous side-scrolling descent, dealing with a prodigious number of threats to their bodily health, and worse, a relentless assault on their mental fortitude! Five hundred feet below the earth you will not only fight unimaginable foes, but famine, disease, and the stress of the ever-encroaching dark. Darkest Dungeon focuses on the humanity and psychological vulnerability of the heroes and asks: What emotional toll does a life of adventure take?
Recruit, train, and lead a team of flawed heroes through twisted forests, forgotten warrens, ruined crypts, and beyond. You’ll battle not only unimaginable foes, but stress, famine, disease, and the ever-encroaching dark. Uncover strange mysteries, and pit the heroes against an array of fearsome monsters with an innovative strategic turn-based combat system.
Darkest Dungeon is not a game where every hero wins the day with shiny armour and a smile. It is a game about hard trade-offs, nearly certain demise, and heroic acts.

80 years in  the future, Mark Evans’ great-grandson Canon Evans encounters Team Ogre,  who plan to travel back 80 years and defeat Inazuma National on the  football field to change the course of history, which in their evil  minds means creating a world without football!

After all, Mark Evans  and friends will need to perfect all the moves at their disposal in  order to defeat Team Ogre and go for glory!

Released only in Japan, Radiant Silvergun offered two modes, Arcade and Saturn mode. The former is all about intense 2D shooting action, while Saturn Mode adds a storyline to the mix and features anime-style characters and voice overs. Radiant Silvergun's most interesting feature is that it did away with the power-up system so prevalent in 2D shooters and instead offered a choice of attacks -- and combos between them. From standard lasers, to split shots, tracking fire, homing blasts, rear attacks, lock-on laser, and the Radiant Sword that can act both as shield and smart bomb, players have to choose the right attack for the right enemy to make it through.In 2002, Radiant Silvergun got its spiritual successor in the Dreamcast release of Ikaruga, which would later be converted for the Nintendo Gamecube.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the world was torn in two between East and West. It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War. October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov’s research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit’s modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.  A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man’s code name is Naked Snake.  Key Features
• Experience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, previously released on PlayStation 2 with over 4 million copies sold, in 3D for the first time ever.
• Auto-stereoscopic 3D viewing capability that endeavors to create a rich jungle world with natural depth in settings of trees, rock/stone, water and more.
• ‘Photo Camo’ system utilizing the built-in camera technology of the hardware bringing customized stealth and camouflage options to the player. By snapping a photo in the real world, players will be able to use the same image as a camouflage pattern applied to Snake’s uniform within the game.
• Utilizing the Gyro Sensor, players will become one with Snake through specialized tilt mechanics throughout the game design. As Snake climbs trees, or traverses bridges and other environmental obstacles, players will be in danger of falling based on the balancing of the system.
• An intuitive menu utilizes the touch screen for quick and easy equipping of items and weapons.

About the Game
 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is set in 2011, one year prior to the events of the  original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game.
A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the  Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of  a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the  once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped  clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone  map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost  territories.
With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to  tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the  fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories,  artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no  more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The  Factions War has begun.
The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition  between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character  experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone  right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.
What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do  anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop  them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many  other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear  Sky.

Building on the critically acclaimed Ferrari Challenge racing simulation engine, SuperCar Challenge heralds the addition of the sexiest supercars on the planet while improving on its spiritual prequel in every way.
Over 40 cars will be available to throw around the most celebrated corners on the racing calendar. Experience the thrills and spills that come with harnessing the full grunt of an Aston Martin DB9, the Ferrari FXX, the McLaren F1 and many more!
More than 20 tracks will also be available, with old favourites such as Silverstone and Spa mixed in with the joys of Nürburgring and the fictitious charms of Riviera!
Features

Eyes Wide ShutPlayers young and old, veteran or novice will be able to enjoy the look and feel of a real supercar thanks to brand new additions to the handling modes, with the ultimate aim being to graduate players through to full simulation handling.

Assist Mode – race with all the assists switched onto full. An amazing way to learn how to drive a supercar and learn the track, but also just great fun. Tear around a track without fear of screwing things up because you forgot to brake at just the right time. This makes the game accessible to so many more people and will even see your gran cruising around Silverstone on a Sunday afternoon with a smile on her face!
Arcade – the power of a supercar with forgiving handling and more powerful brakes. Performance off road will be less but nowhere near as much as in Simulation mode. Breaking into corners and accelerating out of corners is far more straightforward and there’s no need to worry about spinning out all the time. You can REALLY throw your car around a corner and have fun whilst doing it. Don’t forget though – your opponents will be just as aggressive!
Simulation – the critically acclaimed handling returns. Drop your concentration for one second and it could mean you’re out of the race! For the hardcore simulation fans only, albeit with the option to change any of the assist settings.


Gimme A Break!Your opponents’ artificial intelligence has also been completely rewritten with a brand new Dynamic AI setting allowing the game to change the challenge you receive based on how well or badly your career is going. Of course, if you fancy a real challenge you can always set the AI to Legendary… strap yourselves in tightly though because it won’t be an easy ride!
Sitting PrettyThere's a vast car customization suite at your disposal in SuperCar Challenge. Once you've bought your car you can choose from a bulging base paint swatch consisting of matte, gloss, pearlescent and metallic effects. Then it's time to let your imagination fly, and with over 500 different objects available the sky's the limit! Choose from letters, numbers, splashes, tribals, flags, racing lines and many more before positioning, rotating scaling and flipping your way to a masterpiece. By combining various basic shapes (such as circles, squares, triangles, curves and such) over as many layers as you like you can create quite literally any image you like. It's all down to your imagination.

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf.

Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole.

Competition Heats Up – Agent 47 is up against a rival agency of deadly assassins, who are not only competing to take out high-priced targets, but may even be targeting Agent 47 himself.


New U.S. Locations – yes that’s right folks 47 is heading for the US and as part of his tour de force he will be making his presence felt in such iconic American cities, such as the gambling world of Las Vegas, the bright lights of Los Angeles, and mysteries of New Orleans.


Prepare to Make a Killing – New to the world of getting paid for killing? Then don’t worry, just like Leon in the Professional, we will not only give you a hand in how to play, but have introduced a new game play mode to make sure the Rookies amongst us can get in and play the game as we want.


Accidents Happen – What better way to make sure that latest kill doesn’t come back to haunt you than to make your hits look like an accident? The all new accident system allows you even more freedom in your choice of how take a target out – drop a priceless chandelier, use a remote bomb, create a nasty slip into a turning paddle wheel – all designed to terminate your targets without creating alarm or suspicion.


All-new Glacier Game Engine – Since his last outing 47 has found himself in an all new gaming engine, now with a number of new moves and a revamped NPC and AI system the world of being an assassin has never been more realistic.


Sick of getting caught? – 47 now has the ability to hide bodies in boxes and enclosed spaces.

Players can build and maintain a thriving Roman city, develop armies, defend their territory against invading neighbors, or, if they choose, take over the empire by exploiting resources and charming the emperor for power and promotion.  Caesar III builds upon its predecessor in two major areas. First, an entire province is shown on one large map for more seamless gameplay. Rather than monitoring separate screens for city, countryside and battle, all of the game's action takes place on one level. This innovation makes the most dramatic difference in combat. Instead of sending troops off to an anonymous battlefield, there will be street-to-street fighting if the player's defensive measures fail. Another new feature in Caesar III is that the real-time effects of almost all the player's actions are immediately visible on-screen. Before, it was necessary for players to go to report screens to assess their strengths and weaknesses in various aspects of their governance. In Caesar III for example, unemployment and rioting in the city are instantly apparent, as citizens will be seen sitting around or rampaging through the streets. Moreover, the player may ""chat"" with any of the countless citizens bustling around the city for useful information about the success or failure of the city The game also features a highly intuitive interface, a new musical score, and richly-detailed animations, structures and terrain elements - all of which make Caesar III a game that city-building fans everywhere will look forward to seeing on their PC.

For some reason unknown to us, Rabbids decide to take over our beloved amusement park.
We do not know their plan; we do not know their intentions. But one thing we are sure of: they are going to make the most of their day out by invading all the attractions!
They don’t intend to queue like everyone else or stay seated during the whole journey!
As Rabbids will always be Rabbids, you’ll see them misusing the rides, going bwaaah at a souvenir shop before stopping in an overpriced themed restaurant.
So whether it’s a sunny or rainy day, just grab your Wii U GamePad and roll the dice to join them!
Discover how the Rabbids take over the attractions
Rabbids will have a lot on their plate: princess castle, the pirate boat, haunted house, tunnel of love, roller coaster…there are over 20 + attractions waiting to be invaded!
A unique board game with unexpected events
The board game is the center of Rabbids Land and all the action revolves around it. It’s an arena where you’ll be able to play up to 4 players, turn by turn in sessions of 30 to 60 minute. The board game has many to offer: special events that will change all the rules of the game, plus unique items to beat up your friends and steal their trophies. You’ll even get to ask stupid questions, and catapulted to the attractions!
Use the Wii U GamePad in delirious ways
Whether you aim with it, use it to plan your next move, tilt it, shout at it, watch it, steer it, share it, touch it, draw on it, … Rabbids Land is going to make you see your new console in a brand new light through its wacky interactions
There is always two sides to a story
The WiiU GamePad shows its core value through the asymmetrical gameplay it offers. Letting you play coop and versus mode in the attractions. Not only the experience of the game will be lived differently from a player to another, but the replay value is considerably high.
Fun on & off screen
Some attractions will challenge you and your friends to shout at each other, make one and another dance and push you to interact not only with the controller, but also between your buddies.
Use the Wii U without TV
Someone else is camping in front the TV? No problem, with the WiiU tablet you’ll be able to play the full game on your own.

And if there's one thing the Glorious Empire hates, it's magic and magical beings.  As the game opens, the Empire’s Inquisition is on the hunt for anyone who has magical resonance. In the Arctic wastelands, where Yetis roam, lies the snowy town of Nordberg. Here a young lad is singled out by the Inquisition and accused of possessing a magical force (what with him having strange glowing eyes and everything). However, as he is led off, the Empire guards come under attack from a band of strange little leathery, big-eared, yellow-eyed beasts: it’s the Minions! With a rousing cry of “Master” the devilishly charming critters carry the boy off – they’ve found their new Overlord.  After some years of intensive Minion training, players will step into the now-adult sized boots of the Overlord. Initially it’s a rag-tag band of Minions under his command but off they go, looting, destroying and laying waste to the lands around Nordberg, scoring victories where they can, before setting sights on the lands at the very heart of the Empire.  As the Overlord’s powers grow, the secrets of the Empire, and those of his own origins, will be revealed and then it’s time to go Minion maximus on the Empire’s collective ass. Players will be able to choose how to wield the Overlord’s evil forces. Do they plunder and pillage across the lands, burn cities on a whim in wild acts of destruction? Or do they follow a path of domination, enslaving towns and exerting their will upon the people? Only true despots will be able to make the ultimate choice between being a ‘destructive’ or a ‘dominating’ dark lord. "

A realistic experience with exceptional volume
Extensive and profound story!
In this game, in addition to the well-known and popular ""Golden Age Arc"", you will also be able to join Guts and his newest companions on his journey of revenge through ""The Hawk of the Millennium Arc"".
Additionally, the extensive story includes an impressive amount of artwork, including footage from the actual animation movie trilogy and new, original scenes portraying more detailed interactions between the members of the Band of the Hawk and other characters.
Adventure into blood-soaked battlefields
Diverse character selection!
In addition to the main hero of the story, Guts, you can choose to play as any of a number of characters from all the different parts of the story. Every one of these characters possesses a distinctive set of skills and characteristics to ensure the variety of gameplay is consistent with the world of ""Berserk"".
Furthermore, to deepen immersion into the story, the same familiar cast of Japanese voice actors from the movie trilogy and the new animation series were invited to take part in this project.

Intense battles span Europe and North Africa as gamers play as Soviet,  Allied or German forces.


Men of War takes place in Europe and North Africa during the height  of World War II. The story takes place over three different campaigns  and players take on the role of Soviet, Allied and German soldiers. Each  campaign has its own scenario and structured timeline, which brings  different elements of the war to life.
The game features hundreds of accurately modelled historical tanks  and vehicles — including new designs of tanks, APCs and heavy guns — all  of which are ready for your command. Dynamic in-game cutscenes enhance  the single-player by telling the plot, without pulling the player out of  the game experience. What's more, the sounds of war have been given a  new lease of life, with more than 1,000 sounds effects of weapons and  combat gear; all recorded under real operating conditions.
The single-player campaign also features a customisable  user-interface, so players can have the command controls laid out in  their own style. One of the biggest changes for Men of War is the  inclusion of a comprehensive multiplayer, featuring new maps and modes,  including Capture the Flag, High-Value Cargo and more. Also, there's a  refined rating system to ensure a fair fight in online multiplayer  battles.

When they finally manage to destroy all the other supercomputers; they turn their entire efforts to the supercomputer in this Replika.

A world called Tanis. The mysterious town of Refrain resides there.Deep beneath that isolated and forsaken town lies an unexplored underground labyrinth. Nobody knows who built it, or when it was built.
Some say it holds treasures that could control the world, treasures that could make one immortal, and a slumbering demon king whose awakening could end the world. But no one knows for certain. What is known is that the labyrinth is filled with cursed miasma, a substance that brings death to any human it touches.
One day, a witch arrived at Refrain with the intention of exploring this labyrinth. Her name was Dusk Witch Dronya. She had in her possession a legendary book, said to have been written by the only man to explore the labyrinth and survive. The Tractatus de Monstrum...
Systems

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf. Since you are just a mere book, you must rely on the many puppet soldiers that you can bring into the labyrinth to fight for you. Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole. Battles consist of multiple covens attacking and defending themselves from enemies.

This year's edition of the winter sports simulation was completely reworked in order to use the next gen consoles' functions to their greatest advantage. Apart from the attractive sports such as boardercross, ski flying, alpine skiing, freeride skiing, short-track speed skating, figure skating, bobsledding, and biathlon, players of Winter Sports 2010 also have a complex career mode to look forward to.
In the story-based career mode, players can invest any experience points they collect in improved skills and equipment for their characters, and work their way up from beginners to world-class athletes. All of this takes place within a gripping story in which the player takes part in 16 competitions against four national teams. As an added challenge, one of those teams is the player's ultimate rival, and particularly hard to beat.
Winter Sports 2010 also provides ""casual"" entertainment: In single discipline mode, players get to take part in the event of their choice in order to hone their skills in that discipline. Veterans also get their money's worth in Winter Sports 2010. The extended trick system for the disciplines of boardercross and freeride skiing provides the ultimate challenge for experts.
Winter Sports 2010 will also thrill fans of multiplayer games. Up to four friends may compete for the top position in the championship rankings - there can be only one champion, after all.
Eight unique sports disciplines and full online support for all platforms for the first time ever, make for hours of gaming fun. The online mode ""fair play"" launches an event where each participant controls an equally skilled athlete, thus showing the players' real strengths and weaknesses in every discipline. On the other hand, the players' individually trained avatars get to compare their abilities in the online ""tough mode"".
Features:
-       Eight unique and distinct sports: boardercross, freeride skiing, alpine skiing, ski flying, short-track speed skating, biathlon, bobsledding, and figure skating
-       Five game modes: career, cup, single course, campaign, multiplayer
-       Four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, extreme
-       Fair play strips help identify ""good"" and ""bad"" players in the career and online modes; the players' behavior is immediately reflected in the fair play strips
-       Story-based career mode with role-playing elements, special skills, and upgrades
-       Campaign with 44 gripping challenges
-       Multiplayer: online and split-screen modes (up to 4 players)

In an abyss of infinite chaos,
God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Throughout the world, martial arts experts are disappearing. Police from various nations are cooperating in an international manhunt to find the criminal responsible for the murders. Yet no motive has been established, and there is little evidence available. A wave of terror has struck the world, and now even the strongest and bravest of fighters are not safe.

The Town of Light
12 March 1938. Renée, 16 years old, is ripped out of her world, locked up and deprived of everything. Her only fault was that she didn't know what her place in the world was. ""A danger to herself and others and a cause of public scandal"" wrote the police headquarters. The only horror you will find in this game is the truth: a blow to the solar plexus, much more intense than any supernatural presence
The Town of Light is a psychological adventure told in the first person. The story is set in Italy in the first half of the 20th Century in a place which really existed and has been meticulously reconstructed. Exploring and interacting with the environment you will relive the history of the main character through her confused viewpoint and on the basis of your choices, the story will develop in different ways.
