Blocks are falling into the screen and you better get rid of them fast. To do so you have to allign at least 3 blocks of the same colour which will then morph into a rocket and boost up all the other blocks that are stacked on it. You can only arrange the blocks vertically. To add to the challenge the 32 stages in the game have different levels of gravity, quite often you have to form additional rockets within a stack to have enough power to move the rocket out of the screen. It's even possible to make mega-rockets that carry all the blocks on the whole screen.The game features a story mode, time attack, training and a multiplayer mode that supports game-sharing.  "

Such a system adds a layer of depth and strategy to the gameplay, players must decide whether Lucian’s sword will be of more use even during daylight hours and opting to use Aaron’s projectile weapons when he is weaker at night.As the pair explore Lunar Knights’ levels they are accompanied by one of many Terrennials – guardians that will help them find their way through the environment and also offer assistance in battle. Accessed via the Nintendo DS touch screen and microphone, players can unleash the unique power of their Terrennial in the form of ‘Burst Attacks,’ wherein specific movements will spin together tornado attacks, drop rocks on enemies, unleash fire storms, or summon meteors to flatten armies of the undead.Lunar Knights’ content is heavily element-based and made up of Sol, Dark, Flame, Ice, Wind and Earth. The enemies they encounter will also share these attributes, while some of Lucian and Aaron’s Terrennials can also embody these elements and transform the heroes into more advance and deadly forms. This is summoned via a ‘TRC Meter’ which is filled with every monster the pair dispatch, and when the bar is full a TRC button can be pressed transforming the chosen hero into their Dark Lucian or Sol Aaron alter-egos.After defeating one of the game’s bosses, Lunar Knights sees the pair take flight in their Casket Rocket to dispose of their enemies’ undead remains.

With leadership comes great responsibility. The lives of your soldiers and the quest for American Freedom are held together by your courage, charisma, and leadership skills. Because wars are not won alone, a key component of the game depends on the player's ability to recruit and lead fellow New Yorkers in the battle against the Red Menace. An intuitive recruiting command system allows him to give orders to his fellow soldiers and execute critical missions at the touch of a single button.  Players will fight through the recognizable streets of NY with seamless urban fighting that takes place outside as well as indoors.  There are high rewards and penalties for wins and losses in Freedom Fighters. A charisma-based Recruiting System awards points for rescuing freedom fighters or capturing vital installations, allowing the player to recruit more men as well as providing an emotional tie to the fighters.   Your character and recruits engage the Red army with various types of single and two-handed weapons as well as unarmed combat martial arts maneuvers in their quest for freedom.

Just like a great book, players will not only need to hold  the Nintendo DS vertically, they will find the ever-twisting storyline  so captivating they’ll not want to put it down.
That, however, is where the similarities  end – here you can actually influence how the story develops! Decisions  you make throughout the game will alter Kyle’s journey and result in  different outcomes in the storyline.
Every time the player  completes a chapter of the in-game novel Last Window, this episode is  adapted into text form to be read at anytime, meaning you not only get  to enjoy the captivating gameplay, but a great novel at the same time!  The novel also acts as a hint section, directing players to certain  characters should they have missed a clue or conversation.
Set in  Los Angeles in 1980, a year after the events in Hotel Dusk: Room 215,  the story follows the investigation of Kyle Hyde, a former police  officer, as he attempts to solve a mystery involving his father’s murder  and secretive past. Knowledge of Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is not essential  for you to help Kyle crack the mystery behind Cape West, the former  hotel which is now his apartment building.
With beautifully  sketched, fully rendered 3D environments, plus easy-to-use touch screen  controls for navigating environments and controlling characters, it is  easy to lose yourself in this story. You won’t be prompted, but why not  try using the Nintendo DS in-built microphone to solve some of the  mysteries? Jazz fans will also be pleased hear that Kyle shares your  passion – enjoy his favourite music on the Juke Box at any time you  like.
While this game is packed with clues, this game will test  the keenest puzzle solver. Think Professor Layton puzzle solving,  immersed within a great and rich film noir-esque story… and make sure  you look out for extra clues in your game packaging manual…

Armed only with a bubble-shooting machine, the dinosaur must eliminate all of the bubbles before they come crashing down around him. To make things easier, any time three bubbles of the same color come into contact with each other, they pop. As an added bonus, bubbles that are shot seek out bubbles of the same color to create chain reactions. One complicating factor is that the bubbles are steadily falling towards our little green friend. Another complication is the use of pulleys: pop the bubbles on only one side of the pulley and the other side will come crashing to the ground, ending the game. Jumping into the game is fairly easy, but putting it down is much harder. Will the green dinosaur be able to destroy the bubble menace? Play BUST-A-MOVE 4 and find out.

Features: 
Variety of cute characters
Eliminate bubbles at the top of the screen
Arrange bubbles into groups of three or more
Bubbles slowly move downward

More engaging, more challenging, more attractive, and more satisfying, Luminous Arc 2 is the definitive strategy RPG for Nintendo DS owners this holiday season.
New to Luminous Arc 2 is the innovative Engagement System, one of the most jarring changes series veterans will see in the game. (It’s hard not to notice pictures of the Witches in their wedding outfits when Roland chooses to Engage with them.) The system is unique in that it offers Roland a variety of strategic possibilities so long as he keeps the Witches alive. Since the player will gain access to all the skills that a Witch has as well as stat boosts that vary per Witch for three turns, there are a lot of strategies one can build just focusing on Roland’s Engagement.
In addition, the player will also have to decide who to include for a balanced party. Do they decide to field a party of all Witches? Or do they rely on some of the non-magic using members of the party to dish out some damage? It will be interesting to see which strategies end up proving superior in the myriads of online battles that are soon to come...

One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother.

Hearkens back to the golden age of RPGs, complete with tactical  turn-based combat and loads of cutscenes presented through in-engine  animations, complementing a choice set of anime-style storybook movie  scenes.
Game-Spanning Farm and Life Simulation Elements
Grow and harvest crops, catch bugs, quarry for precious gems,  synthesize items, tend livestock, forge relationships with locals and  more, all performed in real time throughout the adventure – and all more  or less optional for those who'd prefer to just focus on the RPG  narrative.
Tons of Optional Content
Extend the 25-hour main story by collecting over 600 unique items,  undertaking nearly 100 quests, decorating your farm with souvenirs,  challenging optional dungeons, and even utilizing StreetPass  functionality to connect with other players and earn bonus items through  treasure-hunting.
Charming Fairytale Narrative for Series Newcomers and Veterans Alike
Filled with well-developed characters, tear-jerking romance and loss,  tales of personal growth, political intrigue and more, players will  fondly remember this story for a long time to come.
Not Just Dual Audio, But ""Trual"" Audio
Play with either of two Japanese voice tracks (one utilizing more  traditional actors for the roles of Prince Pietro and Narcia, and the  other utilizing more modern ""anime-style"" actors instead), or a newly  recorded English dub featuring an immense cast of wonderfully diverse  voice talent.
Fully Customizable RPG Experience
Throttle the encounter rate to a bare minimum or boost it to the max,  lower the difficulty to a cakewalk or raise it to RPG veteran level,  and even choose whether or not the character models are drawn with a  black border around them for that additional ""cel-shaded"" look – the  experience is your own to shape!

Throughout the warriors journey they discover that these bracelets possess great power and decide to use them to their own advantage, with some individuals using them for their own hidden schemes.
The players can now experience the inaugural appearance of magic abilities, allowing characters to wield phenomenally powerful and visually impressive attacks against their most challenging foes. These new-found powers come from the gods’ most divine artifact; the Sacred Treasures. In this distorted, merged version of their worlds, all warriors are unexpectedly gifted with a Sacred Treasure that fuels their spell-casting attacks. Alongside their legacy moves and special attacks, they can now cast ranged and targeted spells, or even combine their powers with those of an ally for truly devastating blows thanks to the return of local couch co-op and online play.

When there’s a mini Mushroom Kingdom dweller who needs to do some travel, there’s always a Yoshi there to carry the Baby to safety. In Yoshi Touch & Go, Yoshi and Baby Mario traverse perilous skies and hostile ground, using the rarely tapped power of cloud formations. This is a platform game where you're in charge of where the platforms go.In this Touch Screen platformer, you protect the falling Baby Mario by drawing fluffy clouds to halt his descent - and if you can collect some coins on the way down, so much the better! If you’ve drawn a cloud in the wrong spot, don't let it get you down; blow into the Nintendo DS' microphone and the clouds you've drawn drift gently out of existence. If you can guarantee Baby Mario's safe return to solid ground, the youngster lands on Yoshi's back.
Once Baby Mario is securely hitched to Yoshi’s back, Yoshi runs through the side-scrolling levels, desperately trying to keep his passenger Baby Mario safe from harm. With gaping pits and cliffs to negotiate (and coins to snaffle for the high score), here you can draw clouds that will let Yoshi climb across the terrain to avoid environmental hazards, as well as the army of bad guys who are intent on breaking up the party. You can also toss eggs at bad guys by tapping them with the stylus - or tap Yoshi to make him leap from danger's path - and finally make it to the end of the level, Baby and all.
These basic gameplay tenets recur across several different modes, with Score Attack, Marathon, Battle, and Time Attack all vying for your attention. A suitably hectic multiplayer game for two players is part of the fun too! Yoshi came, he ‘saur and he conquered…

Protect Baby Mario as he falls by drawing clouds on the Touch Screen and then blow into the DS Microphone to delete them.

A call is sent out, promising rewards beyond measure for anyone who finds a cure. Four mercenaries, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and motivations answer the call. One uses forbidden spells to rain death on her foes, one has guns and bombs to blast his way through, another has a mighty sword capable of slicing through entire packs of enemies, and one other gains strength from savagely tearing through anything that stands in his way with brutal, bladed fists. These unlikely heroes can choose to create a fearsome alliance or venture forth from the city alone. Beyond the safety of the city the land is filled with strange and dangerous creatures, but none as deadly as the evil force behind the curse, which the heroes must eventually confront and destroy. "

The game boasts a solid 60 frames per second, and the over-the-top effects that Rage is known for.

Working for  Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for  colonisation, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and  begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the  planet’s energy supply – Thermal Energy.

The summit looming in the distance holds the answers to your        brother's disappearance, and you plan to bring him back - dead or alive.         Cursed Mountain is a survival/horror game designed specifically for        Wii.  Players will take on the role of Eric Simmons as he tracks down        his brother, who went missing on a trek into the Himalayas to find an        ancient Buddhist artifact.  A sensible man, when Eric first encounters        the angry spirits of the dead, he dismisses them as hallucinations        caused by altitude sickness.  But as he ascends the mountain, it becomes        clear that something is very wrong...  A curse has been placed on the        mountain; the dead spirits of the local monks and villagers are trapped        in the realm of the afterlife or bardo, unable to reach Nirvana or start        a new life cycle.  Stuck in limbo, the restless spirits are very        angry...
Features 

RevolutionaryOne of the first survival/horror games designed        specifically for Wii, Cursed Mountain creates a terrifying setting in a        stylized, atmospheric manner.
Original SettingWith advanced        graphics, Cursed Mountain places the player in a realistic Himalayan        environment.  Players will immerse themselves in the local Buddhist        traditions and rituals.  Everything in the game is based on real world        facts and research...except of course for the outbreak of restless souls.
Vertical Level DesignAs players ascend the mountain, they will        clearly see the summit in the distance, a looming reminder of their        final destination, and they can also look behind to see how far they've        come.
Innovative Wii ControlsDesigned to mimic the physical        aspects of sacred prayer rituals, mantras, and gestures of Buddhism,        combat is comprised of gestures that release the spirits from the curse.         In addition, Cursed Mountain takes full advantage of Wii functionality,        supporting the Wii Remote speaker, rumble and motion-sensitivity in a        variety of triggered action events that mimic natural movements, such as        climbing, running and balancing.
Compelling StorylinePlayers        investigate the disappearance of their brother who vanished while        searching for an ancient relic in the Himalayas. Players climb to the        top of Chomolonzo to discover the fate of their brother as well as to        stop the curse that's interrupting Samsara - the Buddhist concept of        reincarnation.
Environmental HazardsAs players climb higher, the        mountain itself becomes an enemy. Prone to the travails of altitude        sickness and oxygen deprivation, players may not be able to tell the        difference between real enemies and hallucinated ones.

In Persona 3, you'll assume the role of a high school student, who was orphaned as a young boy, and has recently transferred to Gekkoukan High School on Port Island. Only days after he arrives at the school dorm, he is attacked by a Shadow. The assault awakens his Persona, Orpheus, his only chance at defeating this creature of the night. He soon discovers that he shares this special ability with other students at his new school. From them he learns of the Dark Hour, a hidden time that exists between one day and the next, swarming with Shadows that have been slowing claiming victims known as The Lost—poor souls who have inexplicably been turned into walking zombies. Under the supervision of school chairman Shuji Ikutsuki, he joins his new friends in confronting this evil threat. With your school as the primary battlefield, you'll be forced to juggle between two lives: student by day, defender against evil by night. And your greatest challenges await you on the eve of each full moon.

Enter an all-new Evil Dead experience, as Ash finds himself convicted of murder and sentenced to Sunny Meadows, an institute for the criminally insane. Though better than the madness he escaped hidden within the woods, he quickly learns the evil has only become more malevolent. Deep in the basement of an insane asylum, the mad Dr. Vingo Reinhard combines technology with The Book of The Dead, aka The Necronomicon, to fulfill perverted experiments of his very own. Hell-bent on using science to harness the Necronomicon's powers, the malevolent doctor unleashes the book's all-powerful Evil on the world — creating a new breed of Deadites, monsters and experiments gone wrong, twisting reality into a hellish strudel and leaving mankind with that not-so-fresh apocalyptic feeling.  It's just too bad for Vingo that the judge gave Ash a straightjacket instead of the needle...

Sam is willing to use his flea-bitten carcass as anything, from a tiki torch to a bowling ball, to get his revenge. Ash would rather behead Sam then befriend him, but he's going to need all the help he can get against the army of monstrosities that lie in wait.

Yet all that has been averted because a handful of  heroes stood in his path.” – Gandalf the White
The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a  co-op Action RPG that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new  chapter in the War of the Ring. Snowblind Studios is in the unique  position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights  to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a  wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and  never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic  and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.
ACTION MEETS RPG
Intense,  visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character  progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best  loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and  feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with  friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on  all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and  make your own mark on Middle-earth.
CO-OP AT ITS CORE
Build your  own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the  North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon  your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together  or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of  playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The  first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is  desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.
AN UNTOLD STORY
While much  attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the  assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North  turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is  grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not  someone else’s fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through  the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours.  This is your war.

A DESTINY FORGED IN THE HEAVENS
As settlers explored the dark, unknown regions of space, they discovered a celestial port that led to a beautiful and expansive system. It was the gateway to a place they dubbed “New Eden.” Rich in minerals and resources, New Eden was bombarded with throngs of pilots hoping to stake their claims amongst fighters, pirates and corporations. Millions flourished in wealth and millions more died in warfare before the wormhole suddenly closed, severing the colonists from Earth – forever. A dark age fell upon New Eden for thousands of years before four dominant nations-states emerged:
 
* Amarr: Steeped in religious fervor strong traditions, they have the oldest tradition of interstellar conquest
* Minmatar: Toughest of the races, their natural instincts to fight were borne out of hundreds of years of persecution and enslavement
* Gallente: The most economically cunning of the bloodlines, they can go from friend to foe in the blink of an eye
* Caldari: An entire state organized for profit and determined to seize power by any means necessary

Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-em-ups.

It stars a new hero, Kyril, as he initially flees from hideous creatures overrunning the Island Nations, before forming a band of heroes to help repel the invaders. Kyril must also learn about the mysterious Rune Cannons, weapons that, perhaps, could be used against the monstrous beasts.Kyril's quest takes him across a breath-taking 3D world resplendent with varied and detailed environments. Dotted across this are over 50 characters, all of whom can be spoken to and, if appropriate, recruited to the cause. Each character enjoys a distinct personality, and Suikoden Tactic's cast also features 20 characters new to the series. To succeed in his fight against the invaders, Kyril must unite his disparate group and combine their skills as they enter battles or search for items.True to the series' heritage, combat plays a large part in Suikoden Tactics. Huge battles between Kyril's party and masses of the creatures are commonplace, but the true challenge lies in using the surroundings to your advantage - using raised areas to give attacks more range, or attacking rivals in areas where they cannot escape.In all there are over 20 battle scenarios, and the player can constantly tailor the available equipment and upgrade weapons throughout the game. Similarly, a new visual strategic system allows players to keep an eye on the status of their troops via simplified icons, removing the need to summon menus during the heat of a battle. "

'Dwarfs!?' offers an addictive, fast paced arcade-like experience, with plenty of difficulties and game modes to play around in!
As the new overseer for your underground Dwarf base, your job is to manage the small colony and make it as rich as possible, before they meet their inevitable doom! To survive as long as possible, you’ll have to steer and guide your greedy little fellows to the richest points in the caves, while avoiding all the dangers – so they don’t end up destroying your Town Hall and its essential supply of beer.
They explore for you, they mine for you and they fight for you - but if you don't keep an eye on them, they'll do what they do best: die for you and take everyone else with them. But, if all else fails when the Spider Queen comes for you – use the Outpost’s Dwarf Cannon and shoot Dwarfs at her!
There are only 3 certainties in this world: death, taxes and that Dwarfs always dig too deep

The King's mines are set in a large magical sphere and are worked by prisoners captured from across the kingdom. And it is into this sphere that you are thrown, charged with the task of delivering a letter – a letter that might just mark the turning point in the war against the Orcs.
The Gothic world is constantly changing and evolving: events will occur that can alter the relationships between several groups of characters. NPCs are fully rounded with their own daily habits and relationships: they get up, work, go to bed, chat with each other and so on. More significantly, monsters cooperate with each other and are able to figure things out; they have individual perception. Some can be lured with food or noise, some will run away from bright light. Some can only hear or detect movement.
Each character has the ability, with the correct training, to improve particular skills as the game progresses: training with the master of the sword, for example, will result in a character displaying noticeably more skilled swordsmanship. It is so much more satisfying to witness the effect of the skills you have learnt when they are visible in your character as oppose to a meaningless number rating, improving say, from 8 to 10. These 'optical' improvements are for the whole range of skills included in Gothic. The two different classes of magic (which are absolutely independent from each other) work along the same lines.

The glorious days of the once productive mines in this small seaside region were long over. Surrounded by the impenetrable magical barrier, the slaves eked out their miserable existence in this apparently natural prison. One brave man managed to burst the bonds of imprisonment. Following his own call to freedom, he ventured deep into the subterranean temples. Willing to do whatever was necessary, he went out to banish Evil and destroy the magical barrier forever. Spurred by the hatred of men long-suppressed, the prisoners streamed trough the only pass to freedom.

No one in Khorinis had been prepared for this. Too long had they lived under the deceptive notion of security granted by the apparently indestructible magical dome. The small militia garrison could not put up enough forces against the onrush. After numerous bloody clashes, many captives succeded to escape and found safety in the woods or rugged mountains of the surrounding countryside.
The steadily escalating number of raids in the vicinity of the town wall and the bandits' ever-increasing boldness seemed to paralyse the whole town. Angered by the militia's inability to protect their farms, some of the farmers formed an alliance with the refugees, no longer willing to pay allegiance to the king.
Khorinis is facing an uncertain future. Due to the farmers' decreasing production, more and more of the food deliveries do not take place, and the stocks diminish continuously.
The militia's might ends at the town gate. Outside the town wall, nobody is safe from the bandits' armed raids. There is war in Khorinis. A civil war. But there is something else that could not be foreseen. Evil is not dead, rearing its ugly head again. But this time it is set on delivering the deathblow to humanity, and no one can stop it.

Not a simple war between mortals,  easily ended by divine intervention, but a war that split the gods  themselves. Armies such as the world had never seen before, and would  never see again, clashed in the skies of Agarest, across its surface,  and even in the caverns that wound their way through its interior.
As is the way in war, many died on both sides, gods and mortals  alike, and the war left Agarest broken, blackened, and dead. The gods  wept for their paradise, and in a final act of creation, sacrificed  themselves to bring life back to its charred and twisted surface.
Although the gods are long dead, the withering darkness that began  and fueled their war is not. Imprisoned for millennia, its bonds have  begun to weaken, and as they do, a shadow once again spreads across the  surface of the world.
Born into this world perched unknowingly on the brink of the  apocalypse, a young man by the name of Leonhardt and his descendants are  the last, best hope for Agarest. Their journey will span generations  and continents as they strive to once again bring peace to their  beleaguered world, even as the cost of their own souls.

Shedding light on events that transpire before the animated series begins, players get to choose who they want to play as the story centers between two fraternal Soul Reaper twins, Fujimaru Kudo and his sister Matsuri Kudo.

With each character having their own unique skills and strengths, players will be able to adapt to any situation as they build an army of up to eight Soul Reapers.
BLEACH: The 3rd Phantom employs a traditional Strategy RPG gameplay format with an added bonus of anime styled combat during in-game battles. Gamers will enjoy the best of both worlds as the graphics in the field map feature outrageous renditions of BLEACH characters while in-game battles are rendered in beautiful 2-D graphics taken straight from the animation. Once gamers complete the story mode, a bounty of unlockable content awaits them. Multiplayer is also featured which allows up to two players to battle head-to-head via Wireless Mode.

I don’t want to shank it.” Earning the prestigious title of #1 Golfer of All Time can be a nerve racking process and it’s exactly what gamers will experience in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 as they fight off more than just pressure but also the man who’s trying to claim that title for his own, Tiger Woods.   In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06, gamers will attempt to settle the old debate of just who is the #1 Golfer of All Time. They’ll play golf legends such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan on their terms and in their specific eras (equipment, clothing and all). However, Tiger Woods is also there and is after the same goal. It’s your job to find him, stop him, and ultimately supplant him as the #1 golfer of every era. Duel with Tiger in multiple matches as he becomes your nemesis, chasing and even taunting you in every tournament.   Just as it is on the PGA TOUR®, the key to a good shot is execution and precision. In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 both analog sticks are used to give more control than ever over each shot. The left analog stick will continue to control the backswing and downswing, while the right analog stick, or “Shape stick”, controls ball trajectory and spin. Players are now challenged to focus on the impact point on the ball, while thinking more strategically before executing a shot. This also extends to putting where players will have to rely more on finesse and will need to move the analog stick only as far as needed to make the putt  The game of golf is as much psychological as it is physical and a key for gamers in 2006 will be maintaining confidence. With tension on every shot and mounting pressure to become the best, you can either keep your composure or lose it and become that embarrassing hack on the course. Based on good or bad shots or scores you make, a Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease based on the amount of confidence you possess.--EA  "
