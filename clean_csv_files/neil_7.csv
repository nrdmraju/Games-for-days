To ensure their continued work, Vetch infected every slave with a deadly virus, which require a constant dose of antidote.  By controlling the supply of antidote (Catana), Vetch could make sure that no insubordination was possible.  Vetch had only one concern: the Golden Voice.  He made sure the slave population had no knowledge of the Voice, or of the King's promise.  Just to be safe, he placed massive security around the mountain itself so that no one could ever get close enough to ring the bell.
Recently, a young man named Haven, who knew no life other than slavery, began to be haunted by dreams of heroism ... dreams of a bell ... dreams of a King.  When his careless admission of these visions reached the ears of one of Vetch's spies, Lord Vetch immediately commanded that Haven be destroyed.  Haven barely escaped death, and found himself banished in unfamiliar territory, with only his wits and a limited supply of Catana.  Will Haven discover the meaning of his dreams and find the Golden Voice?  Or will Vetch find him first?

SAW is a third-person perspective, survival horror game based on the SAW film franchise, which has grossed more than $665M worldwide and sold more than 28 million DVDs.  The game features many of the deadly mechanical traps seen in the film, as well as terrifying new ones.  Players will pit their wits against Jigsaw as they navigate his world in an attempt to evade and escape his gruesome traps, while also struggling against his minions in brutal combat by using weapons found within the environment.
SAW, the video game, is based on a treatment from Zombie Studios and the creators of the SAW franchise, Leigh Whannell and James Wan.
The timeline for the game takes place between the movies: SAW and SAW II, giving the game its own story, yet fitting within the narratives of the movies.
The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw.  Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp's mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp's career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw's traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game-the likes of which he has been investigating for years-to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others. But each victim has a dark connection to Tapp. Will Tapp save them? Can he survive his obsession to find the Jigsaw killer?
Product Features

Traps of Lethal CunningJigsaw has laid out a gauntlet of torturous traps for a handful of innocents. Only you stand between them and the most brutal death imaginable. Think quickly and act! The clock is ticking.
Choices of ConscienceThe player is forced to make difficult moral choices. Who lives and who dies in the game is determined by the player's choices.
Mysteries RevealedUnanswered questions from the films are finally laid to rest. Gamers will discover the origin of Jigsaw and why he devoted his life to games, while also finding out what happened to the characters from the first SAW movie.
An Ecology of TerrorThe asylum in which Jigsaw has trapped you is abandoned, but it is far from empty. It is a living world of horror populated by Jigsaw's minions and the insane souls they torture... and they have no intention of letting you leave.

However, danger zones remained in the undeveloped Outer section where independently evolved robots, called Mavericks, began wreaking havoc. A group called the Serpent Company scours the Outer universe to provide energy created from otherwise unattainable items to the Inner population and also serves to protect these peaceful nations from Maverick attacks over the years. On an excursion to the Outer region, they discover relics of ancient technologies in the ruins. These relics, called Biometals, are living, conscious materials, with records of information and weapon data from history housed within. Players assume the role of either a human male character named Vent or his female counterpart, Aile, who are employees of the Girouette Express, a courier service that takes jobs transporting anything to anywhere. On a job accompanying their boss, Girouette, to transport a package containing Model X and Model Z Biometals, they are attacked by a mysterious group of Mavericks who seeks to take the material for themselves. During the scuffle, the Model X Biometal is absorbed into the main character, causing a transformation into Model X form while the Model Z Biometal fuses with Girouette. Facing innumerable enemies, Girouette lends his newfound power to his employee and the two substances combine to form Model ZX. With powerful abilities at their disposal, they must discover who the menacing enemies are and what they are ultimately after. In Mega Man ZX, players traverse an open map structure as they face various foes in order to acquire Biometals. The crystallized Biometal data collects at the weak points of bosses, so only by defeating them will players acquire the necessary substances to transform into different Models. The specific powers of each type will help access previously inaccessible areas and progress through the game. Each Model type offers distinct abilities including the ability to break walls, burn enemies with fire, dash through water and more. Bottom LineThe thrills the game offers are top-notch. Hard-core gamers won't be disappointed.   "

For unkown reasons this technology was abandoned, leaving the human race to live in comparatively primitive state. All that remained were scattered mechanical parts and remnants of legendary golems - huge devices built to serve mankind. While the use of technology was mostly out of reach, there were some who researched the ancient devices, seeking to enrich their lives on their desolate world.The situation changed about a hundred years ago when a race known as the Veruni arrived on this world. Similar in appearance to humans, the Veruni's superior physical attributes and advanced technology allowed them to quickly establish dominance over mankind. The human race was relegated to second-class status, with many forced to perform hard labor to survive. Fast-forward to present day. In a small town called Capo Bronco on the outskirts of Filgaia, two youths, Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand, witness an unbelievable event - the giant arm of a golem falling from the sky. Their disbelief grows when they discover within the clenched fists of the golem's hand a girl with little recollection of her past other than her name - ""Avril"". This chance encounter inspires Dean and Rebecca to travel with Avril across the wastelands of Figaia to help her regain her lost memories... Little do they know their journey will decide the date of all mankind...An original story with all new characters, with highly-detailed 3D event scenes with voice-overs.Return of the acclaimed HEX battle system, with all-new features such as interchangeable abilities between party members, varied battlefield layouts, and the ability to switch party members during battle.Huge, fully exporable 3D world with tons of hidden items, quests, and mini-games to discover.Dual pistol-wielding allows the player to shoot various types of bullets to solve puzzles, joining the returning action elements of jumping, sliding, and stomping on the field map.*Xseed Games "

The extreme and unpredictable conditions that characterised  the Lost Planet series return, harsher than ever before. Lost Planet 3  reveals new truths about the foreboding planet and the colonial history  of E.D.N. III.
Lost Planet 3 introduces Jim Peyton, a rig pilot who leaves Earth to  take on a hazardous but lucrative contract on E.D.N. III. Working for  Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for  colonisation, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and  begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the  planet’s energy supply – Thermal Energy.
With NEVEC’s existing Thermal Energy reserve running low the fate of  the Coronis mission depends on the natural source of the energy supply  being located. Realising that this is a great opportunity for a huge  pay-off and early ticket home to his family, Jim braves the risk of the  treacherous environment and threat of the indigenous Akrid.
Acting as a home away from home and boasting an array of tools that  can assist Jim on the field, the utility rig provides Jim’s safety and  is essential not only for his contract work but also his protection  against the ever-changing climate.
Lost Planet 3 will deliver a diverse range of gameplay including  on-foot battles and intense first person action. With a number of  multiplayer modes and a compelling single player experience, Lost Planet  3 will delve deeper into the Lost Planet universe, uncovering hidden  truths within the unique and dynamic environment of E.D.N.

Each pet is a fully personalized experience, enabling  players to customize both the in-game version and physical dog with  different colors and accessories.
The player's interaction with their Wappy Dog determines the pet's constantly evolving personality, skills, and happiness.  Players communicate with Wappy using  commands given through the Nintendo DS™ and he responds both virtually,  by wagging its tail among other tricks, and physically, with vocal  barks and movements, just like a real pet!  One that also sings and  dances that is.
""We were excited about Wappy Dog from the moment we saw it,"" said David Oxford, Activision Publishing.  ""This one-of-a-kind toy and video game combines a strong emotional bond  and exciting virtual experience with the interaction of a physical pet.  Wappy Dog is a truly innovative next generation toy and video game that gives kids an instant companion.""  
Players choose between ""Home Mode"", which enables them to engage with Wappy Dog through the Nintendo DS™, or ""Travel Mode"", which gives on-the-go  players a chance to continue caring for and playing with their pet  virtually without the physical dog. When the player returns home, their  dog's progress instantly transfers to the toy as if they've never been  apart.
The game's unique features include:

Communication and Interaction with Wappy - more  than 18 conversational prompts are answered with more than 350 evolving  responses, with each ""barked"" response translated by the Nintendo DS™  software. Some of the exciting interactions include Wappy singing  adorable tunes in ""Home Mode"" or moonwalking its paws off when in  ""Travel Mode""!

 

Intelligent and Engaging Behavior - Building a healthy and happy friendship is the key to unlocking  Wappy's many tricks. Five mood states are reflected by the colors of  Wappy's cheeks; an unhappy Wappy will be uncooperative and stubborn, so  it is vital for players to keep its cheeks shining bright. With easily  recognizable color schemes, young players will know how Wappy is feeling  at any moment.  

 

Fun and Exciting Mini-Games - Thrilling games build a healthy bond between pet and owner; Cooperative,  competitive or supportive games will continue to develop the friendship  while simultaneously unlocking more games for even more exciting  experiences. Wappy will directly participate in games and cheers when it  wins or sulks when it loses.

 

Nurture and Care for Wappy — Wappy's nickname  can be chosen by the player who will enjoy feeding, bathing and  changing Wappy's style as it matures from a puppy to an adult. Five  uniquely varied age states will be accompanied by changing reactions,  songs and even the pitch of its voice. Players will love caring for  Wappy from precocious puppy tyke to blissfully happy adult pooch.

It lets        everyone in the family use the Wii Wheel accessory in unique and        changing environments, play fun minigames and perform crazy tricks in a        game that builds on the Excitebike and Excite Truck franchises.
Players race around tracks at high speeds while performing stunts and participating in mini-games, all in an effort to earn stars. Players win bonus stars for crossing the finish line sooner, but stunts and style are as important as speed. Stars can be traded for a variety of goodies, like new vehicles, icons and statues.
This game takes the big-air thrills and simple pick-up-and-play controls of Excite Truck and ramps up the fun with a constant barrage of funky challenges and mini-games performed at blinding speed. Players shoot goals, throw pies and even play poker in the middle of rowdy races around off-road tracks.
Six players can race online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in both Excite Race and Poker Race modes. If friends can’t join online, players can exchange ghost data via WiiConnect24 and challenge their friends to outdo their most daring tricks. Just as in Excite Truck, drivers can hit blocks that morph the terrain before their eyes and create ramps from which players can launch mega-jumps. Players can aim for and swing around boost bars or open presents that unleash a variety of wild items, such as bottle rocket boosts or clacker mouths that chomp on other racers to slow them down. Players also can activate in-race mini-games including:

Soccer: Drive into the soccer ball and attempt to hit it into the goal.
Bowling: Drive through the pins and attempt to get a strike.
Darts: Line up your bot and let the dart fly. Try to hit bull’s-eye in the distance.
Clowns: Hit the clown in the face with a pie by throwing it at just the right angle and speed.
Sandwiches: Drive through the ingredients in the proper order to make a delicious sandwich.

The Joint Project, convened to discuss how to deal with the expanding anomaly, decided to send in four ships carrying humanity's finest soldiers and most cutting-edge technology. The mission: to investigate what lay on the other side of what had been dubbed the Schwarzwelt and find out if there was a way to stop it from eventually covering the Earth.  You are an elite soldier hand-picked for the Strike Team, outfitted with a Demonica environment suit and posted to the Red Sprite under Commander Gore. Upon entering the Schwarzwelt, the crew finds itself forced to deal with harsh conditions, supernatural interference, and throngs of demons populating the bewildering world. What exactly is the Schwarzwelt? What awaits at the end of this strange journey? It is entirely in your hands to find out...  Key Features

Shin Megami Tensei goes beyond -- Strange Journey's game mechanics represent a return to the proud tradition of the all-time dungeon-crawling classic SMT: Nocturne, while its story takes players into the near future on a mission to save Earth and to understand humanity's position within the larger universe.
A dark turn into science fiction -- Who or what is causing the black hole that is engulfing the Earth? A mission to investigate the cause uncovers a whole world of demons that humans knew nothing about. Do they seek your destruction or will you seek theirs? Will you decide to save Earth or choose another path for humanity?
Team up with demons -- Demons may be friends or foes depending on your ability to negotiate, bribe, and coerce them to join your party. With more than 300 types of demons, you'll have a huge variety of battlefield encounters and an equally large base of options on which to build your party strategy.

Joined by Parker Luciani, the duo soon finds out that they’re in far over their heads, becoming entangled in a grand story of betrayal and revenge. The horror has only just begun, as strange bio-weapons start to worm their way throughout the ship, turning Jill and Parker’s rescue mission into a fight for survival. You’ll have to use every weapon and tool at your disposal, including the Genesis Scanner, which grants helpful items by gathering combat data on bioweapons, to survive this nightmare.
Experience a story set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 from the perspective of multiple playable characters, hunt for weapons and resources to help you survive, and uncover the truth behind the destruction of the floating city Terragrigia. No need to binge on the story, though, as helpful recaps at the beginning of each new chapter will ensure you never lose your place in the story after gripping cliffhangers.
There’s more to Revelations than the story mode, though – Raid Mode delivers countless hours of extra content, sending players through familiar locales from the game’s story with increasingly challenging enemies. Rank up and unlock new weapons and parts as you complete stages, earning powerful gear and combining weapons and parts that fit your play style. Go for the high score or the fastest times either solo or with a friend in online co-op, and unlock new weapon parts, abilities, and costumes for your favorite character to customize your experience even further. For veteran Raid Mode players, a newly remixed stage called The Ghost Ship: Chaos has been added to push you and your characters to the limit against powerful enemies and intense encounters. If you have what it takes to survive, however, you may win even more powerful weapons and rewards!
Revelations 2 focuses on a pair of intertwined stories. Claire Redfield returns as a member of TerraSave, an anti-bioweapon organization that gets caught up in an insidious plot. Joined by Moira Burton, the two try to escape from a desolate prison island. Meanwhile, Moira’s fan-favorite father and former member of S.T.A.R.S., Barry Burton, is looking for his daughter’s last known whereabouts on the same island, soon crossing paths with a child who claims to live on the island alone. Barry will need all the help he can get, as strange creatures are prowling the halls and caverns of the island.
On top of previous DLC being included in both games, Raid Mode makes a return in Revelations 2, offering up a wide selection of characters, new abilities and skills, and plenty of maps to put your aim and reflexes to the test. Choose your favorite character, customize your gun how you like it, and fight you way through either solo or via online co-op!

Players can ride like 10-time World Vert Champion Mat Hoffman or as one of seven top pros and perform hundreds of freestyle tricks in a variety of realistic vert, street, and dirt courses.  They gave the world Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. You should thank your lucky stars each and every day for Activision. And now they're doing it again, so get down on your knees and wet your pucker for some toe kisses. Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX rides it like nobody's business, combining sick tricks out of this sprocket jockey's catalog with gnarly graphics running on the same killer engine as THPS. The difference? Bikes go where skateboards flake out, and this game is specially designed to be a whole new experience, with street, vert, and dirt courses busted out of real locales and pro concept tracks.  Eight real professional riders--Mike Escamilla, Dennis McCoy, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Cory Nastazio, and of course Mat himself--are on the lip to drop in for some hardcore action, each packing their own set of tricks to throw on the ramps, jumps, curbs, and funboxes on the courses. As with any good stunt riding, half the fun comes in showing up the other guys, and this game delivers with head-to-head multiplayer modes. And when the dirt seems all ground out and you find yourself comboing into rails with your eyes closed from mastery of the game, throw yourself for a loop with the game's BMX Course Editor. You can play those other games with four wheels on the ride...if you really think you need training wheels. Otherwise, put yourself on two tires and show what BMX is all about.

In a future watched over by the all-powerful lunar super computer, “Moon Cell Automaton,” these champions now battle for dominance over this digital realm, known as “SE.RA.PH.” This story takes place after the events described in Fate/EXTRA, and depicts the world as it appears following that previous Holy Grail War.
Players will experience the story of Fate/EXTELLA: The Umbral Star from the independent perspectives of the three factions wrestling for control over SE.RA.PH. and face off against foes from a variety of Fate productions, including characters from Fate/EXTRA, Fate/stay night, Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha and Fate/Grand Order, in fast-paced combat. A new form change battle mechanic called Moon Crux debuts in this entry to match its series-first gameplay style, transforming the player-controlled Servants and granting them considerable powers that allow them to devastate enemies and take formidable challenges head-on. The game will contain the original Japanese voices.

Boogie on DS invites you to get your groove on to some of the hottest hits in disco history as you turn your self-created Boog into a superstar.
The aim of the game is to keep your Boog’s feet moving to the beat by simply drawing lines with your stylus on the Touch Screen. As long as you follow the on-screen instructions and keep the rhythm, the music will keep playing. Funky dancing will also cause your top screen to become increasingly populated with party freak creatures keen to join your personal party! Mess up, however, and the party freaks will clear off – leaving you to face the music on you own. When they’ve all gone, your dancing days are over.
Before you take the floor, you’ll have to select from one of five unique Boogs then customize their look by choosing from more than 500 items of clothing. You can even design your own patterns for them to wear by just drawing on the Touch Screen! In Career mode the object of the game is to dance your way through five different storylines, progressing up the rankings and unlocking new songs as you go. During dance sessions you’ll be thrown into fun mini-games that will boost your overall score if you can stay on your toes and complete them successfully.
If you really want to prove you are worthy of a place in the limelight, why not challenge your mates to a dance-off in multiplayer mode? Up to four people can compete against each other if they all have their own copy of Boogie, while Single-Card Play means that even if your friend doesn’t own the game you can still connect wirelessly and give them a lesson in how to get their groove on!
And just in case you still don’t feel like dancing, Boogie comes complete with a 3D mode and set of 3D glasses that really bring the action to life before your eyes! So what are you waiting for – the floor is yours!

Groove to 20 hit songs from down the decades, including famous floor-fillers from disco, funk, pop and rock.

Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure. The game is presented in a colorful cartoon style with short videos, full voice acting, and sing-along songs designed to engage young children while still teaching basic skills.

Ballistic-based weapons still rule the day, and soldiers are still driving tanks and being dropped into the battlefield from the air. But those tanks hover, and the dropping doesn’t involve parachutes. Instead, they rocket to the ground like meteors burning up on reentry into the atmosphere. Technology has advanced so much, but war is still war, and you’re not going to be fighting aliens with crazy magic-like powers.
 More than just a game focused on your individual achievements, Section 8 intends to re-create large-scale battles over large-scale landscapes. Even though the game is more than a year and a half away from release, the running gameplay that was shown to us at publisher Gamecock’s recent EIEIO event—powered by a heavily modified version of the Unreal 3 engine—looked very smooth and the draw distance was really impressive. The developers claim that it’s already in a playable state, and they’re already battling it out around the office with some regularity. One other neat detail about the maps is that they are randomly generated. When you see the detail that’s been put into them, you’ll be impressed by that factoid. So, the game focuses on massive team-versus-team-style combat, with large capture points being fought over by large numbers of players. How else do the developers foster some awesome team play? For one, vehicles have multiple seats—more than say, a warthog—and each one can have a unique influence over the overall firepower of the ride. There will also be fairly deep character customization, from the choosing of weapons to such accessories as jet packs, shield boosters and other equipment. Tailoring your loadout and working in conjunction with your teammates looks like the keys to victory in Section 8.

Consumed by anger at the injustice he has suffered and swearing  vengeance, Asura discovers he can use this fury to his advantage and  turn it against his enemies. Cue relentless action  as Asura finds himself facing off against numerous unique enemies,  including planetary sized bosses, unleashing devastating and visceral  attacks.
Asura’s Wrath loses the traditional  distinction between gameplay and cutscenes through seamless player  controlled narrative. Simply put, even in cinematic sequences the player  can control Asura, directly affecting the gameplay, making Asura’s  Wrath a truly unique experience.

FEATURES • New type of action game: Asura’s Wrath will seamlessly  blend action and narrative and will adopt an episodic nature, more akin  to a TV drama series.
• Relentless action: Asura’s Wrath keeps placing gamers in tight situations and says ""now get out of that"".
• What the…?: Unique enemies and planetary sized bosses will continually challenge players’ expectations.
• Innovative setting and story: Fusing Asian mythology with sci-fi , Asura’s Wrath’s universe will be truly unique.
• Collaboration with CyberConnect2: Continues Capcom’s strategy of  partnering with the best developers to produce titles to complement its  own internal projects.

In a land where might makes right, it is Ragnar who doles out justice on the blade of his massive battle-axe. The unkindest cut is always that cleaved on the edge of a battle-axe. Swords are elegantly deadly, chainsaws at the very least have their sound, and even the lowly machete earns some menace for its mane alone. But when you really want a weapon that says, ""This is going to cause some deep hurting,"" little else strikes terror into the hearts of the soon-to-be heartless like a thick-butted double-bladed battle-axe. That's the weapon of choice for the hero of Rune: Viking Warlord, and he does some mass damage with its wicked blades. Tearing through brigades of hell's spawn with clubs, swords, and of course ragged-edged axes, valiant Ragnar will have to cut down the evil spawn to stop an invasion and save an imprisoned god. Hewn limbs can be used as weapons, up to four combatants can take arms for multiplayer melee, and all sorts of other terrible things take place in the amazingly rendered 3D world of Rune.

Pictures feature film and more than 60 years of DC Comics' lore, Superman Returns™: The Videogame will create the ultimate open-world super hero experience.  As the Man of Steel™, you'll hone your unworldly super powers such as Flight, X-Ray Vision, Heat Vision, Super Hearing, Super Strength, Super Speed, and Super Breath to fight villains that only Superman™ can defeat. Explore your super powers to discover new uses and combinations: use Heat Vision to melt a rogue car or as a focused laser-like beam to cut through thick metal; use Super Breath to move heavy objects or freeze villains into solid ice. You can also combine powers and interact with your environment; for instance, freeze water spouting from a broken fire hydrant into a giant icicle with your Super Breath and use your Super Strength to hurl it at an enemy.  Get ready to take flight, as Superman Returns' revolutionary new mechanics allow you to take full command of your aerial maneuvers. You're not limited to flying over 800 mph (faster than a speeding bullet™) — you can also corral your enemies, perform stunning in-air acrobatics, instigate Super Speed missile-like attacks, and much more.  In Superman Returns: The Videogame, you explore and protect the truly living city of Metropolis — one that is not only expansive (with 80 sq miles and over 10,000 buildings), but also changes dynamically with you as you affect gameplay. Citizens will run away in terror from newly-erupting danger and also exit their cars to cheer and snap photos as you fly overhead to save them.  Superman may be invincible, but Metropolis is not. Player choice matters, as Metropolis' destruction will affect your ability to progress. You must face the internal conflict facing Superman at every turn: will you pause your pursuit of super villains to stop a massive tornado sweeping through the city and save its civilians? Every decision made is critical to Metropolis' existence and can affect the collateral damage meter, which ultimately keeps the player in the game.

Takatora Tōdō, Naotora Ii and Munenori Yagyū also make  their first appearance in a ""SAMURAI WARRIORS"" title released outside  Japan. Additionally, the appearance and attack moves of existing  characters such as Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda have also been  completely overhauled. Featuring more than 50 playable characters, this  title is an entirely new ""SAMURAI WARRIORS"" experience.
Tales from the various forces throughout Japan are woven together to  create the rich tapestry that is the history of the Warring States era.
The game's main mode, Story Mode, is separated into two parts,  regional stories, which tell the tales of the officers of various  regions around the land such as Kyūshū and Shikoku, and the story of  unification, which details events up to the end of the Warring States  era. By way of contrast to previous games in the ""SAMURAI WARRIORS""  series, the battles and the stories surrounding them will be portrayed  by faction, allowing the dramatic relationships between characters to be  explored in more depth than ever before. Experience the convictions,  intertwining ambitions and motivations that each character bears for  yourself.
New attack moves deliver even more exhilarating action!
The immersive battles pitting a lone warrior against countless  swarms of enemies that the series is known for are back. New moves have  also been added, such as Hyper Attacks, which enable you to rapidly  close the distance between you and your enemy and swiftly dispatch them,  and Rage mode, which powers up your attacks when your Spirit Gauge is  full. Additionally, the character attack types and development system  have been overhauled, maintaining the ease of control that the series is  known for while introducing all new levels of depth to the fighting  system.
Travel across Japan with the new Chronicle Mode!
Journey across the lands of Japan while completing various  quests, meeting new officers and collecting items in the new Chronicle  Mode, which lets you explore the world of ""SAMURAI WARRIORS"" for  yourself. In addition, the Create Character feature has been vastly  upgraded, allowing you to create your own unique characters. With more  ways to customize them than ever before, it's easier than ever to put  your own personal stamp on the history of the Warring States era.

All creatures of ancient myth, legend and lore are real. They've just been sealed away for thousands of years inside Pandora's box, waiting ... for you ... in Legendary. When a thief named Deckard is hired to steal an ancient artifact, he unwittingly triggers a war between man and myth.
Griffons rule the skies, werewolves tear the innocent limb from limb, and cities are held under siege as creatures we'd dismissed as imaginings of our ancestors prove to be very real and very angry for being held prisoner for untold millennia. As the only person able to return these creatures to the box, Deckard finds that he must work with a shadowy secret society to save civilization before it is torn apart by tooth and claw.


Legend meets reality: Modern military firepower confronts the tooth and claw of legend in a massive, blockbuster experience with spectacular run and gun firefights and battles.
Dynamic environments: Skyscrapers fall and your world crumbles around you. See London burn to the ground and witness New York torn apart in spectacular supernatural destruction, as modern society faces the beasts of myth.
Incredible and unnerving A.I.: Werewolves scale vertical  walls in an effort to find a path to you, and beware, for they will use environmental objects to gain an advantage.
Awesome battles: Take on enemies from the size of a child all the way up to spectacular titan creatures tens of stories tall.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.
Enter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently.
Some matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary ""S-rank"" bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl.
And what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever...

Bilbo leaves the comforts of the Shire on a journey through Middle-earth to help the Dwarves reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor within the Lonely Mountain. Along the way, he is introduced to ravenous Trolls, dangerous Orcs and, of course, Gollum and his precious ring.

Become Ruler of the World by establishing and  leading a civilization from the Stone Age to the Information Age. Wage  war, conduct diplomacy, advance your culture, and go head-to-head with  history’s greatest leaders as you attempt to build the greatest  civilization the world has ever known.
Civilization VI offers new ways to engage with your world: cities now  physically expand across the map, active research in technology and  culture unlocks new potential, and competing leaders will pursue their  own agendas based on their historical traits as you race for one of five  ways to achieve victory in the game.

EXPANSIVE EMPIRES: See the marvels of your empire  spread across the map like never before. Each city spans multiple tiles  so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local  terrain.
ACTIVE RESEARCH: Unlock boosts that speed your  civilization’s progress through history. To advance more quickly, use  your units to actively explore, develop your environment, and discover  new cultures.
DYNAMIC DIPLOMACY: Interactions with other  civilizations change over the course of the game, from primitive first  interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances  and negotiations.
COMBINED ARMS: Expanding on the “one unit per tile”  design, support units can now be embedded with other units, like  anti-tank support with infantry, or a warrior with settlers. Similar  units can also be combined to form powerful “Corps” units.
ENHANCED MULTIPLAYER: In addition to traditional  multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide  variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single  session.
A CIV FOR ALL PLAYERS: Civilization VI provides  veteran players new ways to build and tune their civilization for the  greatest chance of success. New tutorial systems introduce new players  to the underlying concepts so they can easily get started.

The The Spirit Camera™: The Cursed Memoir game invites players to experience supernatural thrills they won’t soon forget, using the built-in camera functions and augmented-reality features of the Nintendo 3DS system. The game’s mysterious storyline involves a girl named Maya who has been hiding in the darkness of an old house, cursed by a malevolent woman in black. To free Maya from the curse, players must use the “diary of faces” – a 16-page AR notebook included with the game - to view ghostly images and interact with the world Maya is trapped in. The Nintendo 3DS system becomes the Camera Obscura in players’ hands and is capable of revealing the supernatural and dispelling evil spirits. The lines between reality and fiction blur in this chilling horror adventure.
Features:


The included “diary of faces” is a gateway into the game’s absorbing Story Mode. When viewed through the lenses of the Nintendo 3DS camera, each page of the book displays a variety of augmented-reality experiences.
Some pages of the book come to life in the form of video segments that reveal past events and shed light on the game’s central mysterious storyline. Others appear to send spirits floating into players’ real-world surroundings. Some page even summons players to virtually enter a haunted house where Maya is hiding.
Additional modes let players use the system’s camera in spooky ways. In Spirit Photography, they can take photos at their leisure and watch as haunting visions appear within the pictures. Spirit Check, lets them snap pictures of themselves and their friends to uncover the eerie spirits that surround them. In Spirit Challenge, they can put their own face or a friend’s face on a spirit and then battle it.
Players can also use the notebook with their Nintendo 3DS system to face other challenges involving a mix of memory, hide-and-seek and other game play elements all with a supernatural twist.

The player has the possibility to choose from the 2008 official riders, teams and tracks, but also to improve the performances of his bike, managing and tuning a lot of aspects like top speed, gear ratios, suspension stiffness, and set of tires for single race. “SBK-08 is fun and accessible for everybody”. SBK-08 features a deep simulation mode that aims to capture the attention of “bike enthusiasts” who perfectly know every aspect of tweaking a bike. At the same time the revised full arcade mode gives the player the opportunity to understand the complexities of bike riding by introducing complexity in layers. The arcade mode of SBK-08 will fit their needs giving them a 100% enjoyable and fulfilling experience, void of any frustration

Persona 5 is a game about the internal and external conflicts of a group of troubled high school students – the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets in the game’s story – who live dual lives as Phantom Thieves. They have the typically ordinary day-to-day of a Tokyo high schooler – attending class, after school activities and part-time jobs. But they also undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. Their power comes from the Persona, the Jungian concept of the “self;” the game’s heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective mask and confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and use it to strive to help those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the masks modern-day society wears.

In 1931, Winston Churchill was hit by a taxi in New York. In the real world, he survived, and went on to rally the British people to fight the Nazi threat. But what if he hadn’t?
 It’s from this premise that Fall Of Liberty takes it’s theme - without Churchill’s leadership, Europe and the United Kingdom have fallen to Hitler’s forces. By 1951, using crushing technical superiority, the United States is invaded and defeated by the Third Reich. With this setting, Fall Of Liberty will be an FPS experience like no other; a game that’s both a World War 2 FPS and something different. Fighting not as a soldier, but a resistance fighter in a United States of America that’s under the rule of a foreign power.  Exclusive to next-generation platforms and PC, Fall Of Liberty breathes new life into the FPS genre.

Features

No boundaries racingFUEL is a groundbreaking racing game without boundaries – on and off-road, two and four-wheeled vehicles race a massively diverse environment inspired by the most challenging real areas of the American wilderness. Experience exhilarating races in a huge range of vehicles, explore over 5,000 square miles of wildly different terrain from deep snow to arid river-beds, battle the elements and pull off spectacular stunts in epic world on an unprecedented scale.
Vrooom with a viewIn FUEL if you can see it you can drive to it. With a jaw-dropping draw distance of 40KM, there’s never been a world so large to explore or so many striking vistas to discover. The entire game world is available for players to explore in free-roam and provides a challenging, compelling environment for FUEL’s stunning race events.
Dramatic, dynamic extreme weatherSet in an environmentally damaged fictional future, the game world is further brought to life with real-time extreme weather that includes blizzards, lashing rainstorms, lightening strikes, sandstorms and tornados that transform the terrain and affect vehicle performance creating a unique race experience.
Choose your own route, win in your own styleWith a huge range of vehicles, player choice lies at the heart of FUEL’s action-packed races as players speed across huge swathes of diverse terrain, carving out on-the-fly routes to take the chequered flag. Roadsters reach extraordinary speeds on the asphalt, monster trucks steam-roller through forests and dirt-bikes scramble down mountainsides as gamers take on dangerous short-cuts, death-defying jumps and clatter through spectacular cross-over points in a beautifully realised wilderness.
5,000+ square miles inspired by wildernessFUEL’s world is created from the most compelling, diverse and striking areas of the North American wilderness, from the Utah badlands, to Yellowstone Park and Arizona. Recognisable landmarks, including Death Valley and Mount Rushmore, are modelled from satellite data and rendered beautiful by the game engine. The effects of accelerated global warming – from sandstorms, blizzards and brush fires to tsunamis and tornadoes – create uniquely unpredictable and spectacular races.
Online multiplayerThe online and offline worlds become one with a fully-integrated multiplayer featuring hundreds of preset challenges and countless locations where friends or strangers can meet to show off their skills and their customised rides or set out to explore the world together.

The ability to time travel will sometimes cause time paradoxes resulting in gamers meeting and assisting past and future versions of themselves.

YOU are the Dragon:- Burn Villages!- Kidnap princesses!- Collect treasure!- Roast pesky knights! - Compete with other Dragons in epic multiplayer battles!
In classic medieval fables, knights would travel the kingdom in search of dragons to slay and treasure to take. What a mean thing to do!
HOARD is a game that puts you in control of the real hero of the tales...the DRAGON!
Around you, a new kingdom of humans is threatening to put you out of your hoard and take what you have. The only way to maintain your quality of life is to make sure that kingdom doesn't succeed!
If you can steal enough gold from the kingdom, the people will be bound to pack up shop and find some easier place to settle. Attack their wagons! Raid their food carts! Burn down houses! Make them think twice about ever waking you from your peaceful, centuries-long slumber!
Of course, burning everything in sight doesn't get you as much gold as you'd like. Really, you need to let those towns and crops grow just enough to crank out out some real treasure. Then take it!
And if you get lonely, capture a fair maiden and bring her back to your hoard for conversation. Kings will pay good gold to get them back. Just watch out for those pesky knights!

Gameplay:Play as your favorite Fantastic Four team member as you assume their personas and master their individual attributes and unique powers to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. 
Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards – Use Mr. Fantastic's ability to stretch in order to attack from a distance, squeeze into tight spaces and reach places no one else can. Use his brainpower to heal characters, hack computers, over-ride security systems and take control of enemy's weapons to use against them. 
Invisible Woman/Sue Storm – Play as the Invisible Woman to turn invisible and perform stealth moves with ninja like speed or use her telekinetic powers to immobilize enemies. 
Human Torch/Johnny Storm – As the Human Torch, players can create walls of fire and supernova fireballs, shoot fire from their fingertips and bend flames at their will as they ward off enemies. 
Thing/Ben Grimm – Use Thing's raw brute force to pick up objects or tear them apart, break through walls and obstacles and obliterate enemies.  While playing as a team of one to four characters, the game lets players dynamically switch between characters during their adventures and combine super powers in order to level more devastating attacks and accomplish missions.  Play through the game with a friend in two-player co-op story mode or fight against each other head-to-head in multiple arena battles each with their own special powers and attributes.

Features:
Relive the movie experience with character likenesses, locations and villains from the upcoming summer blockbuster.

This epic journey propels Death  across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War,  the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in  Darksiders. Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the  series is primarily a hack ‘n slash adventure. The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.
