The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.

Amped® 3, like snowboarding itself, isn’t just about the sport. Sure, it all starts with riding huge mountains, finding seams through the trees in hip-deep powder, and tricking your cheeks off … which is why there’s an all-new physics engine, perfected controls, and the most authentic riding experience at some the world’s greatest winter resorts.
The soul of snowboarding, however, is all about style. So, in Amped 3, there’s incredible customization, a fat helping of boarding culture, and huge snowboxes loaded with killer gameplay. With a new ParkBuilder, insane, bone-breaking sledding, and snowmobiles for exploring, you can be who you want, go where you want, and do what you want.




Co-op Sledding:  Survival crash mode while sledding. Hang on for your life and try and see how far you can make it down the hill before launching yourself into spectacular crashes that are scored based upon the anticipated medical bill.
Snowbox: The resorts are winter wonderland playgrounds now with lots of other stuff to do besides snowboard. Spend hours exploring and discovering new and secret places to test your skills.
Snowmobiles: Jump on a snowmobile for an entirely new mountain experience. Downhill or uphill it doesn’t matter—you can explore, trick and race anywhere.
Massive Mountains: Seven real resorts, three times larger than levels in Amped and Amped 2. These levels are truly living mountains, immersive with interesting character interaction, behaviors and object manipulation. You'll be able to traverse and explore these massive levels to discover a new definition of gameplay.
Backcountry: You're no longer limited to resort runs or terrain parks. Expansive and serene backcountry areas are now waiting to be explored. You’ll always get first tracks, while carving up the fresh powder and tricking off natural features.
Real-time Plantable Physics Objects: Players have the power to add and build anything from basic ramps to intricate structures that they can use to access new areas of the game, or simply set new hang-time records.
Surface Tricks: Who needs a jump or a rail to pull of a killer trick? If it’s covered with snow you can now surface trick it. Use these to chain together sick combos.
300+ New Indie Music Tracks: Amped 3 offers up more fresh tracks to help you fully enjoy the powder experience.
Simple Controls: Simplified and easy to learn controls: Anyone on the first run can pull off big tricks, and play with all the mountain toys with a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment.
Online Leaderboards: Play Amped 3 on Xbox Live®, where every individual Snowbox challenge has its very own global leaderboard, allowing you to compare your best scores against the rest of the world.

Protect the princess and vanquish the oppressing armies in this dramatic tale of treachery, deceit, and mistaken identity. As the false prince, is yours a legacy of darkness or a road to shining glory for the kingdom of Bretwalde? Pay the price and choose your path in this innovative new SRPG.

Route Maneuver System: A dynamic innovation in SRPGs lets you hit multiple foes while improving your defensive position, but beware - enemies can do the same!
Customizable Skills: Earn points to buy more skills or strengthen the ones you have!
Multiple Endings: Key decisions will determine the parth of the story and the ending you'll receive.

Rondo of Swords is a strategy RPG that's divided into several parts: Story, where the characters converse; Battle, which uses a unique combat system; and Preparation, which allows you to develop your characters, form your party, and so on.
As the game progresses, the player will gather new allies and move the story forward. Depending on your actions and the characters you use in battle, the story can change, resulting in four possible endings.
In this game, the player army and enemy army take turns fighting. One turn consists of the Player Phase, followed by the Enemy Phase. Some chapters will also have a Visitor Phase where guest characters will act in between the Player and Enemy phases.

Two warring factions arise from the rubble: the Echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the Sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time. Units Descriptions
Echelon

Enforcers Enforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the Echelon. Determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, Enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the Chancellor. They are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

Grenades: The Enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
Riot Shield Up: The Enforcers activate their energy Riot Shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


Infiltrators The arbiters of justice, Infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the Echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. Trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the Echelon infantry, Infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. All Infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. The Infiltrator always strikes its target.

Thermal Vision: The Infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


Prowlers Prowlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. Unmatched for their versatility, Prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. Echelon Commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

Search the Skies AA Mode: The Prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



Sai

Rangers Rangers perform two functions within the Sai hierarchy. Firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting Sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, Rangers form into Militia Platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to Sai commanders. Armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, Rangers are best deployed in numbers. When the Rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. They can also fire Sai energy charges at air targets.

Sai Anti Air Rockets: The Rangers can fire Sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
Commando Rush: The Rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


Spectres The silent knives in the night, Spectres are a true nightmare for Echelon soldiers to handle. They have an exceptional ability to control Sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. Able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the Spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. The Spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. The fact that Spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

Mind Control: The powerful mind of the Spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
Cloak: The Spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. The shimmering can be detected from up close though.
Rapid Slice: The Spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


Scorpions The Sai may not be as technologically advanced as the Echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. Scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around Sai villages and to provide light strike power for when Sai forces go into combat. The Rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

Sting: A ceramic shell-filled with Brood acid charged with Sai energy. On impact it does minimal damage, but greatly reduces the armour where the shell hit.

Bustin’ a groove to dance clips is fun, but that's nothing compared to mixing your own tracks. Far and away the coolest ""gadget game"" on the PlayStation 2 (or probably any other system, for that matter), MTV Music Generator 2 ups on the underground fave original with thousands of riffs and beats to work with. This get-up is so pro styled, it's got Apollo 440, Bentley Rhythm Ace, and Funkmaster Flex's endorsement--with a little hands-on experience, you can mix your own real rock, pop, garage, trance, house, indie, and R&B songs.For spits and giggles, there is a game in here--watch trippy 3D videos of your music compositions, or swank out a party with a four-player ""Music Jam""--everybody gets to jam over a running beat (tie in a multitap for PlayStation 2 and put up to eight riffers in). Still, the real draw of MTV Music Generator 2 is its ability to do some nearly studio-quality tracks. How real can this thing get? Try buzzing into the Riff Editor to write your tunes note-for-note using your own guitar or other instrument riffs, and then sweeten it with effects like echo, delay, and reverb. And for true beatmasters, send in the mail-in cert from the box and order the MTV Music Generator 2 Sample Kit--a USB peripheral that lets you import your own samples from CDs, tapes, or even your own voice! Puff Daddy, you're about to get some challegers...

Bomberman debuts on PSP sporting his colourful cartoon guise, bringing the same cheeky gameplay tactics that have made his games famous, with new elements taking involvement to a superior level.
Fans all over the world have been voicing their excitement at the prospect of multi-player Bomberman played wirelessly via PSP. Frantic multi-player action is the core Bomberman experience, and there are 20 maps for up to four contestants. Basic multi-player can be enjoyed using Game Share off one UMD, but there are benefits if all players own the game.
The arsenal now includes bombs that take out a whole row of blocks, or those that spread fire across an area of the grid. Hilarious poisons inflict in such ways as reversing the player's controls, or dropping bombs involuntarily. Special abilities enable players to see through walls, and even walk through them, plus give extra strength to push many bombs at once.
Imaginative level design benefits both single- and multi-player aspects, and there are 100 to survive in 'Normal' story mode. Here the newly added ability to save items for later use increases the tactical scope, and could be the key to success. A further 50 levels of 'Classic' single-player Bomberman action, based on the very first game in the series, is also opened up to those players who can finish the 100 levels of Normal mode.

Slayers! Go forth and eradicate the Oni menace! Experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
Trapped in an endless battle against the deadly Oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""Slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. This game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger Oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
Open World
From the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. The lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the Otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the Oni. The Otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. Experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. You will come across many colorful characters and deadly Oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
Evolved Attacks
The ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the Oni's body parts. The giant Demon Hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive Oni into the ground with ease. You can also extinguish the life force within an Oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
All-new Story
You assume the role of one of the Slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. During the fierce battle known as the Awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to Mahoroba Village. Waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the Professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the Oni.

You control a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen and shoot at the pixelated alien spaceships which are scrolling down the screen towards you, all the while avoiding their weapons' fire.
A lot of other elements have changed though: there’s a much more intense sense of speed to the game, compounded by excellent presentation, from the fitting music and superb sound effects that make the game even more addictive and involving, to the psychedelic backgrounds and splashes of vibrant colour. It’s an incredibly short game, so keep that in mind when considering a purchase.

Slayers! Go forth and eradicate the Oni menace! Experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
Trapped in an endless battle against the deadly Oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""Slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. This game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger Oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
Open World
From the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. The lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the Otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the Oni. The Otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. Experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. You will come across many colorful characters and deadly Oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
Evolved Attacks
The ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the Oni's body parts. The giant Demon Hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive Oni into the ground with ease. You can also extinguish the life force within an Oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
All-new Story
You assume the role of one of the Slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. During the fierce battle known as the Awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to Mahoroba Village. Waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the Professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the Oni.

From renowned producer and game designer Hideo Kojima (MGS2) comes Boktai, the first game to use sunlight to influence gameplay! Boktai follows the adventures of a boy vampire hunter named Django who must overcome traps, defeat enemies, and fight through the deepest parts of dungeons to rid the world of evil. Watch out for the amount of sunlight - Django is stronger by day, while the vampires are stronger by night!
Entering a series of vampire strongholds, the game's hero, Django, must battle his way to the catacombs of a number of castles, before exposing their inhabitants to the fatal rays of the sun. It is by adding a solar sensor to the cartridge, however, that Kojima-san adds an incredible twist to the game: in order to actually defeat the vampiric hordes and their undead underlings, the player must use actual sunlight to destroy them!
The idea of a light-sensitive game comes from Hideo Kojima's desire to combine the natural and gaming worlds in some way. As such, Boktai's solar sensor encourages the user to play the game outside to stand a better chance of defeating its vampire adversaries. It also ties in beautifully with the fatal effect of light on the vampires, with exposing the sensor to direct sunlight infusing rooms within the game with deadly light, thus killing anything it touches.

A great witch from a realm yet unknown brought darkness to the world. Anise was her name. The odious witch was defeated by the guardians of the great tree... But legend tells that her darkness and curse seeped through realms and spread over to many other worlds.
And yet another legend has it- That when the world was still covered in darkness- The Mana Goddess used the Sword of Mana to defeat the benevodons that would lead the world to doom, and seal them into eight stones...
This is how the darkness subsided and the world was created. After completing her creation, the Mana Goddess turned herself into a large, wizened tree. It is told that the Mana Tree and the sword continue to watch the world from the forbidden Sanctuary.
Time has passed- Valsena, the kingdom of green fields. Ferolia, the kingdom of beastmen; Altena, the kingdom of sorcery; Wendel, the holy capital; Laurent, the aerial fortress; Nevarl, the fortress in the sand. The nations of the wolrd were shrouded in a peaceful but fleeting slumber...

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

When assassins from Agent 47’s contract killing firm, The ICA, are systematically eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger more powerful agency has entered the fray. Sensing that he may be the next target, Agent 47 travels to America, where he Prepares to Make a Killing.

Features:

Money Talks, Silence Pays – This time you not only get paid for your jobs but you get to make a decision on what you do with your hard earned cash. Do you spend money on getting the latest weapon upgrade or do you bribe the police to clean up the last job so none knows you did it?


Competition Heats Up – Agent 47 is up against a rival agency of deadly assassins, who are not only competing to take out high-priced targets, but may even be targeting Agent 47 himself.


New U.S. Locations – yes that’s right folks 47 is heading for the US and as part of his tour de force he will be making his presence felt in such iconic American cities, such as the gambling world of Las Vegas, the bright lights of Los Angeles, and mysteries of New Orleans.


Prepare to Make a Killing – New to the world of getting paid for killing? Then don’t worry, just like Leon in the Professional, we will not only give you a hand in how to play, but have introduced a new game play mode to make sure the Rookies amongst us can get in and play the game as we want.


Accidents Happen – What better way to make sure that latest kill doesn’t come back to haunt you than to make your hits look like an accident? The all new accident system allows you even more freedom in your choice of how take a target out – drop a priceless chandelier, use a remote bomb, create a nasty slip into a turning paddle wheel – all designed to terminate your targets without creating alarm or suspicion.


All-new Glacier Game Engine – Since his last outing 47 has found himself in an all new gaming engine, now with a number of new moves and a revamped NPC and AI system the world of being an assassin has never been more realistic.


Sick of getting caught? – 47 now has the ability to hide bodies in boxes and enclosed spaces.

THE AUTHORITY IN WWE VIDEO GAMES RETURNS WITH WWE 2K16!
The newest addition to the flagship WWE franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new WWE Superstars, Divas and Legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
Features 
•Largest Roster Ever: Offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin alongside Seth Rollins, Daniel Bryan, Dean Ambrose, Bad News Barrett, Paige and Finn Bálor, WWE 2K16 includes the largest roster in WWE games history
-The roster contains an unprecedented combination of current WWE Superstars and Divas, emerging NXT talent, WWE Hall of Famers and WWE alumni from multiple eras
•Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator: Fans who pre-order WWE 2K16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator:
-T-800 from The Terminator and T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
•2K Showcase: The franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in WWE 2K16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in WWE history. Along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•MyCareer: The franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from NXT to WWE to earn a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame. In addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•Creation Suite: Building on last year’s foundation, WWE 2K16’s Creation Suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including Create a Diva, Create a Championship, Create an Arena, and Create a Show. Key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including Create a Superstar, Create an Entrance, Superstar Studio and Community Creations.
•WWE Universe: WWE 2K16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. In addition, for the first time, Superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•Online: Completely overhauled based on fan feedback, WWE 2K16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the WWE Games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•Soundtrack: Players can customize their in-game music through the addition of Superstar entrance music to the WWE 2K16 Jukebox. Additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•Gameplay Improvements: WWE 2K16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest WWE gameplay experience to date:
-Improved Controls: The controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. This change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. WWE 2K16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. Opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-New Reversal System: The reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  Each Superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces Major and Minor reversals for select moves. Minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. Major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. Successful Major Reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-New Pin System: The new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. If the opponent kicks out, a Superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. Dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. There is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. Rope Breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. In line with WWE live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-Chain Wrestling: New positions and attributes allow players to distinguish Superstars from one other. There can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-Working Holds: Working holds are new for WWE 2K16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. Just like on WWE programming, Working Holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-Improved AI: WWE 2K16 sees big improvements to the AI for Superstars, referees and managers. For example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. In addition, significant changes are included for match-specific AI, including Tag Team matches.
-More Match Types: Many match types of been added for WWE 2K16, including Ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-Dynamic Entrances: With the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their Superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. Why wait for the bell? In WWE 2K16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•Additional Improvements: WWE 2K16 also includes an improved Submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•Overall Enhancements: WWE 2K16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-New Commentary Team: For the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with John “Bradshaw” Layfield, new to WWE 2K16 joining returning commentators Michael Cole and Jerry “The King” Lawler. Thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-Visual Upgrades: This year’s title features several thousand new animations. WWE Superstar and Diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. Improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-Broadcast Presentation: Gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. Significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

Computer technology, bio-engineering, cybernetics and mechanics accelerated at such an incredible rate, it forced industrial competition to the point of uncontrollable and ruthless corporate espionage.
While the government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tail spin. These wars between giant corporations a.k.a. ""GI-Corps"", gave way to more complicated, advanced and unethical methods. The kidnapping of corporate executives and replacing them with clones capable of downloading company secrets was becoming commonplace. Soon, murder and terrorist tactics became tools of choice in the battle between the GI-Corps.
Something had to be done before the once great country destroyed itself or became target to outside invasion. An agreement had to be made between the government and the GI-Corps before America was torn apart. So a radical concept was introduced to prevent the possible loss of millions in the increasing wars between GI-Corp controlled states.

While the Enlightened was on the side of good, helping his people how and when he could, the Dark One was quite the opposite, full of hate and devilish works - and so the never-ending battle between the Enlightened and the Dark One persisted for centuries. Humans suffered terribly thanks to this constant combat between the two – combat which shook the universe to its very core. Finally, thanks to a trick, the Enlightened succeeded in banishing the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in an Artifact - but in doing so, the Enlightened lost his own divine powers, because the two divine beings were inseparably linked to one another. This is how two Artifacts came to be hidden in a huge Temple - and how the Enlightened prevented the downfall of the entire universe. However, these two artifacts contain total, absolute power - both good and evil. Any human being who comes in contact with the powerful stones will be horribly cursed - and the power of darkness will once again be awakened.  The game begins when a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up - and it shows the location of the artifacts. The adventurer Ayumi starts searching for the immensely valuable stones. Powerful forces against which she is helpless threaten to awake in her body. Now it's up to her to discover what the secret of the curse is - and at last defeat the darkness.

It is a dark, heroic fantasy game that combines original storytelling techniques with classic role-playing challenges.

In Dragon Age, your choices change the world and affect the people around you. Certain situations, storylines, and conversation options will change drastically depending on your origin and your motivations. You choose your origin, and from that starting point, your story begins. You play through your character's early days, defining his or her background and motivation and begin to learn more about the world of Ferelden from your own distinct perspective. Your choice of origin defines how you will view the world and how it views you. Choose a sneaky, disrespected commoner and you will play a story that focuses around subtle skills and careful wordplay. Choose a noble origin and the world will be much more positive and helpful, but those jealous of your status will not be afraid to take what you have, violently if necessary.

A massive compilation of role-playing adventures, the Ultimate Edition of Dragon Age: Origins contains the original game, the Awakening expansion pack, as well as a variety of additional DLC packs. "

While the Enlightened was on the side of good, helping his people how and when he could, the Dark One was quite the opposite, full of hate and devilish works - and so the never-ending battle between the Enlightened and the Dark One persisted for centuries. Humans suffered terribly thanks to this constant combat between the two – combat which shook the universe to its very core. Finally, thanks to a trick, the Enlightened succeeded in banishing the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in an Artifact - but in doing so, the Enlightened lost his own divine powers, because the two divine beings were inseparably linked to one another. This is how two Artifacts came to be hidden in a huge Temple - and how the Enlightened prevented the downfall of the entire universe. However, these two artifacts contain total, absolute power - both good and evil. Any human being who comes in contact with the powerful stones will be horribly cursed - and the power of darkness will once again be awakened.  The game begins when a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up - and it shows the location of the artifacts. The adventurer Ayumi starts searching for the immensely valuable stones. Powerful forces against which she is helpless threaten to awake in her body. Now it's up to her to discover what the secret of the curse is - and at last defeat the darkness.

Magnetica puts a new spin on puzzle games.
Marbles are exclusively controlled by the stylus in this fascinating        title that satisfies even the strongest puzzle addiction.
Marbles are rolling relentlessly down a twisted track toward you. Stop        them by launching new marbles with your stylus. When three or more        like-colored marbles match up, they vanish. Tons of power-ups, multiple        tracks and a great multiplayer mode make Magnetica a must for        puzzle/action fans!
A seemingly endless array of fresh twists will keep drawing you back to        single-player Magnetica. Switches, tracks that pass over or below each        other, and moving barriers that deflect marbles will keep you flicking        marbles for hours.
Features 

 Innovative use of stylus to flick marbles 
 Ultrarealistic magnetic physics: Launched marbles will curve toward          like-colored balls 
 Incredible depth in three single-player modes: Challenge, Quest and          Puzzle 
 Multiple paths and scads of power-ups and hazards will keep you on          your toes 
 Consult the all-in-one dashboard on your top screen 
 Show off your Magnetica personalty by battling a friend head-to-head 

Single-player items boost your score, slow down or stop time, or reverse        the course of the marbles. Versus weaponry includes Ion Clouds (smoke        screens you'll have to blow away via the DS mic), Recoils (which block        marbles), Black Holes (which suck up launched marbles), Viruses (which        deflect marbles) and Gravitons (which alter the path of launched        marbles).

Central                              to the game's single and multiplayer experience is the                              idea of a freeform battlefield, where players are given                              the freedom to choose how to complete a given objective,                              allowing for creativity and surprises, rather than heavily                              scripted events and tightly contained spaces traditionally                              used in this genre.
An advanced AI system allows NPCs to react and fight                              realistically, see and hear others, and respond as a                              team. Rogue Warrior offers a new take on the multiplayer                              experience, with 10 gameplay modes and a system whereby                              maps are created using tiles that are selected by each                              team. Rogue Warrior's tiling system allows users to                              experience over 200 maps in both day and nighttime settings.                              In addition, the campaign features solo and on-the-fly                              cooperative play for up to four players, where anyone                              can join or leave an existing campaign game at any time                              without having to go to menus or save progress.
In Rogue Warrior, you play Dick Marcinko, leader of an elite SEAL unit trapped behind enemy lines in North Korea on a covert mission to assess the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. When war breaks out between North and South Korea, you must try to lead your team back into South Korea while greatly outnumbered and with no support and limited resupply. Your journey will take you through a variety of never-before-seen environments inside of North Korea, including submarine pens, shipbreaker yards, prison camps, and more.

""Let's Play Ballerina - Sparkle on the Stage"" focuses completely on the art of ballet.
Classical dance is one of the most popular hobbies among girls. Ballet tells a story, expressed through music and dance instead of words. In this new simulation for Wii and Nintendo DS, players take on the role of a 12-year-old girl, who has just been admitted to a very prestigious dancing academy. During her period of training, the heroine commits herself solely to dancing. Her dream is to become a great prima ballerina. But the path to success is full of challenges. Also, she should never underestimate her fellow students, because some of them would do anything to outdo their competition. But only the best will get a chance to shine, and therefore players will have to keep proving and improving their skills. Luckily, they are getting support from Nathan, a young, very talented dancer, the heartthrob of every girl in the academy. Together, they train between lessons, so that the heroine can make her dream come true and become a famous prima ballerina.
""Repetto Presents Ballerina"" is set in the academy, as well as an opera house. The single player title offers awesome dance animations, gorgeous 2D and 3D graphics, and a gripping story filled with passion and adventure. Just as in real life, hard training is a main factor. At the same time, the game tries to convey values such as friendship, loyalty, and helpfulness.

There's a truly epic atmosphere as you embark on a glorious quest, cast in the roles of Arthur, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors and Guinevere. This dramatic game uses footage and character likenesses taken directly from the film, so you will be transported onto the same battle stages. All the drama you expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer movie production is faithfully recreated; it's adrenalin-pumping action all the way.
An innovative combat system allows you to fight solo or co-operatively, on foot or even horseback. You'll need to think on your feet, however, in order to emerge victorious from the multiple mission types comprising of so many diverse goals. The whole experience is geared towards a cinematic presentation, of the standard associated with Touchstone Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer. The realism, and painstaking attention to detail of King Arthur the movie is mirrored in Krome Studios' game.

The Characters
Jacob Silverspring is the oldest of the Silverspring   children and he is also the one that remembers his grandfather the   most.  Having followed his grandfathers footsteps studying ancient   literature, Jacob believes it would be 'gnarly' to find out what   happened to the ol' adventurer...as long as he gets  to do too a little    adventuring himself.
Silvia Silverspring takes after her grandfather the   most.  Inquisitive and inventive, fearless and forceful when it comes  to  their grandfather's disappearance, Silvia's prodding has kept the   search ongoing.  As far as she is concerned, she needs to know what   happened to him, and will not rest until the 'problem' of his   disappearance has been overcome.
Fiendishly Frantic Gameplay
Jump into fast-paced action as you explore new environments and   discover hidden secrets – but beware – danger lurks behind every corner!   You'll have to combat rats and bats, ghosts and gargoyles to survive   the Haunted House and solve its mystery.

Heroes of Stalingrad will  take the award winning Red Orchestra franchise into the next generation  of gaming. Cutting edge graphics and audio built on Unreal Engine 3,  inventive features and streamlined realism will deliver an unrivaled  WWII experience. Focusing on the Battle of Stalingrad and the  surrounding operations, both German and Russian, from July 1942 to  February 1943 the game allows the player to experience one of the most  brutal battles in all of human history. For the first time ever in a  first person shooter gamers will be able to experience WWII from the  Axis side in a German single player campaign. As always with the Red  Orchestra franchise, Tripwire will aim to deliver unrivaled accuracy and  attention to detail, along with gritty, vicious combat in multi-player,  co-op and solo modes. Again, Tripwire have listened to the fans and  have designed a whole set of new features to make the game more  accessible and easy to get into – all while delivering the tactical  shooter realism fans of the original game loved.
Features:
RO multiplayer taken to new heights: Tripwire’s  renowned MP already exceeds that of much of the competition – the new  game will stretch that lead even further. With highly addictive and fun  varieties of game-play online, the game will feature everything from  quick, brutal firefights, through to more intricate and challenging  simulation modes.
Persistent Stats Tracking and Player Progression: Persistence constantly gives the gamer something to strive for and keeps  them playing. Grow in rank, earn medals, improve your abilities, and  become a Hero – all visible to the complete online gaming community and  embedded within the game.
Heroes: Obtain the ultimate goal and become a Hero  online. Players with hero status inspire troops around them and cause  fear in their enemies. Heroes have access to the best and rarest weapons  and equipment, and will stand out visually from the rest of the  soldiers.
Stalingrad Campaign: The Stalingrad  campaign will feature the multiplayer maps used in a campaign layout  recreating the battle for Stalingrad from both the German and Russian  sides. This will be enhanced with story elements through the form of  mission introductions and in-game cinematic sequences that begin and end  the campaign.
Unique Focus – the Battle of Stalingrad in depth: takes  the familiar WWII genre into a unique direction. Far removed from the  well-trodden Normandy setting, gameplay is based on fresh scenarios and  actions the player has never experienced before. Follow the German army  as they assault the city of Stalingrad, to the banks of the Volga.  Follow the Soviet army as it holds the city against all the odds then  destroys the Axis forces.
First person cover system: Experience the ultimate  firefights that a cover system allows, from the immersion of a first  person view. Peek or blind fire over and around cover and more.
Squad Command: Command fire teams on the battlefield  using an easy to use first person interface. Suppress the enemy, send a  fire team to flank them and hit them where it hurts!
WWII weaponry redefined: true to life ballistics,  bullet penetration, breathing, adjustable sights, free aim, weapon  bracing, photo-real graphics and more, create WWII weaponry that has no  equal.
Morale: Experience what it is like to be a soldier  in one of the bloodiest conflicts in history and the importance of a  soldier’s state of mind and how it can turn the tide of battle.
Single Player Campaigns: Play through a full German campaign AND a full Russian campaign, in iconic engagements from the Battle of Stalingrad.
Enhanced Unreal® Engine™ 3: Built on an enhanced version of Unreal Engine 3 the game features cutting edge visuals and features.
And coming after release:
Co-op: Players can connect with their friends and  battle AI in multiple game types including the Stalingrad Campaign,  Skirmish Mode, and more.
Offline Challenges: Offline challenges such as the  shooting range and assault courses let the player learn and hone their  skills to perfection with all of the weapons and features in the game.  Training with different challenges to achieve awards, win competitions  and improve their skills the player can pit their best times/scores  against the rest of the online gaming community.
New vehicles: We will roll out new vehicles for the game, including new tanks as well as armored transports.

In the middle of the twenty-second century, mankind's thirst for excitement has spawned an evolutionary sporting event that draws from the combined disciplines of rally racing, demolition derby, and high-performance aeronautics.
In Fatal Inertia, each craft is armed with a unique array of unconventional weapons that manipulate velocity, force, and even time. Explosive magnets that impact racecraft stability and rockets that can counter thrust and velocity are just some of the dangers drivers must face.
Through harsh environments spanning dense rainforests to immense glacier fields, and canyons of razor-sharp rock there is little room for error as drivers will reach speeds of over 500 mph. But Fatal Inertia is not merely a test of speed. The brave men and women who choose to compete must face the mental and physical punishment of low-altitude combat maneuvering.

Players must help Ginger and her flock make a break for freedom while avoiding the evil Mrs. Tweedy and her oafish husband, who want to turn them into chicken pies.

Set in a 3-D world that reflects the film's style, design, and atmosphere, the gameplay emphasizes stealthy exploration. You must sneak your way around the farm and gather objects that are necessary to your escape plan.

Explore the wild and capture its natural beauty on film in Wild Earth: African Safari, a unique simulation for the Wii based on the PC game from Super X Studios.  Take award-winning pictures of exotic animals in their natural habitats without disturbing them. From running with herds of zebra to following hunting lions and scavenging vultures, Wild Earth: African Safari lets you risk it all to capture and create magazine-quality pictorials! Winner of the 2008 Editor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review!


Complete 11 picture-taking missions with both primary and secondary objectives. Investigate the bold hyena during a midday thunderstorm. Observe gentle giraffes in the hidden valley from the aerial view of a helicopter. Meet a family of elephants as they take care of their young, etc.

An exclusive new Safari Game mode only for the Wii lets you use the Wii Remote to play from the animal's perspective in 11 different games 
Includes more than 30 African animals including: cheetah, crocodile, crowned crane, elephant, flamingo, frog, bat, gazelle, giraffe, hippo, hyrax, leopard, lion, ostrich, oxpecker, pangolin, rhinoceros, meerkat, tortoise, trout, vulture, warthog, wildebeest and zebra 
Brand new cooperative multiplayer mode gives players the choice to drive the vehicle or snap photos while playing with anywhere from 1 to 3 friends.
Photos collected are placed into an animated slide show presentation of informative articles. In addition, players can select their own favorite photos to keep in their portfolio.  
The Impact Meter tracks how much of a disturbance you are to the natural habitat. If you disturb too many animals or get too close to them, your Wii Remote will rumble at varying degrees, making it harder to take a steady picture. If the Impact Meter becomes completely depleted, you fail the mission.
Experience accurately presented flora and terrain from the Serengeti National Park in Africa, at different times of day and in varied weather. Grasses, shrubs, flowers, kopjes (rocky outcroppings), streams and lakes provide a life-like experience and terrific photo opportunities.
