“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""

HIDE DURING THE DAY. LEAVE ONLY WHEN NIGHT COVERS YOU.
During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive.
MAKE LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS. FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

What follows is a frenetic race for survival as the 'Nemesis' demon sets a series of increasingly hard challenges within the fully interactive - and destroyable! - play areas.
The cars in Pocket Racers represent the soul of the stricken player, and can be augmented through the collection of 'Soul Shards' which litter the play area. Collecting these allows the user to inflict massive damage on rival cars or the debris that clutters the race area, while additional weapons such as nitro boosts, missiles and ice can be used to sneak past opposing racers. These extra weapons are left around the courses, and must be gathered before your opponents get them. The courses themselves range from a messy bedroom, a conveyor belt-laden factory and a kitchen, and feature sneaky short cuts and hidden extras for the player to find. Pocket Racers also features a number of vehicle styles that are ideally suited to the varying locations. Sports cars, trucks, 4x4s and Coupes vie for the player's attention, while other hidden vehicles can also be unlocked.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

Leaving the Mediterranean behind, the city-building series makes its first foray into the Orient and immerses the player in brand new surroundings. China has existed for over 4,000 years, but its 4,000 year history has been marked with new technologies and ideas replacing – or enhancing – the old. This is the world in which the player will take the reigns of leadership and take their cities through the twists and turns of Chinese history.

Beautiful surroundings. A flock of pheasants with brilliantly colored feathers flies away in fear of the hunter's sharp arrows. Buddhist monks leave their strikingly beautiful pagodas to enlighten the city's residents. Entertainers in richly decorated costumes march down the street to celebrate the New Year. These are but a few of the sights upon which the player will feast his eyes in Emperor.
For the first time, multiplayer gameplay. Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom offers gamers their first opportunity to play a city building game with their friends, online via the Internet. A great variety of both collaborative and competitive multiplay games will be offered. Players may need to collaborate in building one of China's engineering marvels, or there may be a common goal for all cities to attain a certain affluence. In competitive multiplay, players take sides – or may be a side unto themselves – and fight for sole power over China.
Familiar concepts, ancient beliefs. Both the Chinese zodiac and the concept of Feng Shui play a role in Emperor. Players choose an animal to represent themselves while they play, and receive benefits based on that animal's role in the Chinese zodiac. In addition, the concept of Feng Shui, the harmonious arrangement of objects in relation to their environment, must be taken into consideration when designing cities. The player achieves a high level of Feng Shui when his city is designed efficiently and when people are surrounded by beautiful structures.
Changing times. As the player progresses through time in Emperor, many of the goods and resources he depends on in one era are replaced by better resources in the next era. As advancements are discovered, efficiency increases. For example, a soldier armed with a steel sword is much more powerful than one armed with a bronze weapon, and paper money can be printed faster than metal coins can be struck.
Monuments. In Emperor, the player can build many of the edifices for which China is well known, including The Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, the Hall of Light, and Su Sung's astronomical clock tower.
Diplomacy and trade. Players can employ emissaries to help establish trading relationships with other cities, or use spies to gather information that will help plan attacks on rivals.

Players compete in both turn based and also real time strategy battles, plotting moves and attacks in the turn based section and getting hands on by switching to the real time combat mode where they’ll be in charge of firing and reloading the weapons. The emphasis is not on trying to blast everything that moves however, as the player will often leave their vessels exposed and in significant danger.

As you would expect with a game of this nature, it’s perfect for two-player action and the wireless connections of both machines enables friends to compete against each other. With 20 single player missions to take on and the option to customise the player’s own flagship, there’s plenty to get stuck into.

Extreme Mode features 16 new tracks, 16 new bikes, a currency system, and full bike customization. The MotoGP circuit racing includes 17 original tracks and an all-new seeding system that lets you identify other racers in your skill level while moving up the ranks.

Buggy mode is very specific to V-Rally 4. You will need more than just your driving skills to come out on top. There are different routes through the off-road tracks: it's up to you to find the shortest path to victory. In addition to being a good driver, you also need to be clever!
V-Rallycross
If any one word can suffice to define V-Rallycross, it's ""spectacular"". For years it was the refuge of group B monsters, cars so powerful that FIA banished them from the world rally championship. A few visionaries then had the idea to race these vehicles on tracks that are less than one kilometre long, making for wild competitions.
Hillclimb
In Hillclimb, the course gains altitude. Your driving skills at the wheel of phenomenally powerful cars are put to a severe test over long and winding tracks. Hillclimbs are doubtless one of the most dangerous and demanding disciplines in motor sport.
Extreme-Khana
Extreme-Khana is a combination of several disciplines: drifting, rallycross (with respect to the rather untamed cars), and time attack. Added to all that is a dash of the drivers' genius and creativity. Extreme-Khana is one of the most incredible motor sports on the planet.
Rally
Rally is a unique sport, comprised of several timed stages, called ""specials"". The teams reconnoitre these sectors, compiling notes about them. This valuable information enables the co-driver to tell the driver what lies ahead.

Before you do anything else, download the game and play the tutorial. It’s fun, it’s free, and it’ll teach you the foundations of Heroes of the Storm better than any webpage ever could. But once you’re done, come back and learn about all the things the tutorial doesn’t cover.
Things You Should Know After Playing the Tutorial

Movement: Getting your hero from A to B should be second nature.
Abilities: Slinging spells and using skills, easy as pie.
Combat: Health bars, attacking enemies, healing, and when to tuck tail and run.
Death: It’s just a flesh wound!
Minions: Enthusiastic, single-minded, team-oriented. Also, great cannon fodder.
Forts: Hurt like hell; make sure you have some minions with you.
Leveling: Gather XP, level up, become stronger.
Mercenaries: Defeat them at their camp to gain their service.
Cores: You lose your core, you lose the game.
Hearthstone: Press “B” to teleport back to your base. (Cards? What cards?)
Mount Up: Press “Z” to summon your mount and move faster.

Those are the basics of Heroes of the Storm. Enough to play and have fun, but a far cry from complete mastery of the game. What’s that? You’d like to master the Storm? Well, we can certainly assist you with that. Like we said: we’re here to help

アーケードでロングヒットしたシューティングのパワーアップ移植版!
 

 

収録ゲームその 1　シューティング技能検定テンポ良く、数々の簡単操作 & 簡単ルールのミニゲームをこなし「ゲーマー年齢」を測定する史上初のシューティング「検定」ゲーム。ゲー ム中には、藤野社長のニヒルでシュールなギャグ演出と、ゲーム好きがニヤリとするような有名シューティングゲームのパロディを満載し、幅広い層が楽しめる ように工夫がなされている。今回の移植は基本的にアーケードゲーム「シューティング ラブ。2007」に収録された「シューティング技能検定」がベースとなる。Xbox 360　版では、アーケード版には無かった「4　人対戦モード」や「新ゲーム (新検定種目) 」の追加で大幅にパワーアップをとげた。また検定種目を任意に選択し、集中的に練習も可能となっている。

収録ゲームその 2　エクスジール攻撃方法、攻略方法、稼ぎシステムなどが、選択する機体 (全 4 機体) によって大きく異なる、システム重視なフルスペックシューティングゲーム。当作は近年の縦スクロール型シューティングゲームには珍しい、当たり判定の付いた「地形」が存在するのが特徴。Xbox 360 版では、「画質や処理スピードの向上」「プレイアビリティ向上」は勿論、「連射対応」「Xbox LIVE による機体別ランキング」「2P 側機体でのプレイ」「リプレイ保存」など至れり尽くせりな機能が多数実装されている。

収録ゲームその 3　トライジールRemix2004 年にゲームセンターに登場した「トライジール」のアレンジ移植。「シ ンプルかつストレート」なスタイルのシューティングゲームと謳いつつも「1P 2P での機体性能差/隠し機体/隠しキャラクター & 隠しボーナス/ルート分岐」などの、多数のやり込み要素に加え、プレイヤーサイドから編み出された「ダダダ撃ち」「レレレ撃ち」「画面左下ボンバー」と いったゲームを有利に進めるための「ネタ」「テクニック」の存在も相まって、シンプルに見えて実態はかなり奥深い内容となっている。

収録ゲームその 4　-0 (マイナスゼロ) Xbox 360 用ソフト「シューティング ラブ。200X」のために製作された、トライアングル・サービスの完全新作シューティングゲーム。固 定画面上に大量発生する敵キャラ、敵弾をロックオンショットのみで破壊する。単純明快なシステムに加え「破壊衝動」「爽快感」「中毒性」を徹底追求したよ うなゲームデザインゆえ、発売後「-0患者」が多数出現しそうな予感。 当然、Xbox LIVE によるスコア争いも熾烈になりそうだ。なお当作の BGM は超有名シューティングゲームコンポーザーが担当しているという噂だ。

実績について『実績』については「実績の達人」もビックリなシュールで斬新、およそ常人 (失礼！) には考えも及ばないような解除ネタからお約束系ネタまで「シューティング ラブ。200X」収録全タイトルに満遍なく入っている模様。全員期待しておくべし!!

同梱特典　ナイスDVD 2！DVD収録容量限界 (約4時間) たっぷり「シューティング ラブ。」な内容の攻略 DVD がソフトパッケージに同梱される。『エ クスジール』全 4 機体のハイスコア映像 (解説テロップ付き) 、及び『シューティング技能検定』のスーパープレイ映像、2007 年下半期に開催された業務用シューティングゲーム初の全国大会 『シューティング ラブ。甲子園』のハイライトから藤野社長製作の連射測定ミニゲーム『射ウォッチ』の衝撃的記録映像までをも収録し、更に各コンテンツの副音声ではゲーム製 作者の藤野社長と各プレイヤーによるオーディオコメンタリーが再生可能。

With over 7,000 TV shows as a presenter under his belt – most famously, Cheggers Plays Pop - and a myriad guest appearances in the nation’s most popular television programmes, Keith Chegwin has also fronted his own radio shows, written regular newspaper columns and made several records! The fact that there are very few Britons that have never heard of him is testament not only to his popularity, which is due in no small part to his infectious charm, but also to the fact that he remains one of the UK’s hardest working stars.
Spanning more than three decades, Cheggers’ career has seen more than a few ups and downs but he has always bounced back with renewed vim and maintained his position in the very hearts of the UK’s TV viewing public. Now he adds another feather in his cap as the presenter of Oxygen Games’ new quiz title; Cheggers’ Party Quiz, enthusing;
“This is such a fantastic project - I'm so excited by it! I have been very impressed by Oxygen Games, because of their enthusiasm for this project and I hope that everyone who plays the game thinks it is great fun.”

PES 2008 will feature a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It will learn counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use.  Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers will hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates will make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built.

This Xbox 360 exclusive will take the frantic one-on-one fighting game series in an exciting new direction as an intense tactical action game. 
“Guilty Gear 2: Overture retains a lot of elements that fighting games are known for, so it’s cool to see how familiar moves like the Gun Flame make the transition to 3D,” said Michael Manzanares, Project Lead, Aksys Games. “Only now, you’re facing off against an entire army instead of just one character. You’ll lose (badly) if you think you’re a one-man army, so you definitely have to remember that you have your own army to command.”
Guilty Gear 2: Overture Prologue
In the far future, humanity succeeded in developing an endless energy called the ‘Divine Power’. But, although they were able to obtain wisdom, mankind could not cast aside their foolishness. Tension among the major powers led to the creation of biological weapons that were based on that power – Gears. 
Justice, the only Gear able to command the legions of biological weapons, went berserk and declared war on all of humanity. That was the beginning of the worst war in history – The Crusades.
In response, mankind formed an order of elite knights, and with their participation, Justice was defeated. With her fall, all Gears ceased to function and entered a dormant state. The long-lasted Crusades came to an end, and it seemed like peace had been restored.
However, true history has yet to reveal itself…

Buggy mode is very specific to V-Rally 4. You will need more than just your driving skills to come out on top. There are different routes through the off-road tracks: it's up to you to find the shortest path to victory. In addition to being a good driver, you also need to be clever!
V-Rallycross
If any one word can suffice to define V-Rallycross, it's ""spectacular"". For years it was the refuge of group B monsters, cars so powerful that FIA banished them from the world rally championship. A few visionaries then had the idea to race these vehicles on tracks that are less than one kilometre long, making for wild competitions.
Hillclimb
In Hillclimb, the course gains altitude. Your driving skills at the wheel of phenomenally powerful cars are put to a severe test over long and winding tracks. Hillclimbs are doubtless one of the most dangerous and demanding disciplines in motor sport.
Extreme-Khana
Extreme-Khana is a combination of several disciplines: drifting, rallycross (with respect to the rather untamed cars), and time attack. Added to all that is a dash of the drivers' genius and creativity. Extreme-Khana is one of the most incredible motor sports on the planet.
Rally
Rally is a unique sport, comprised of several timed stages, called ""specials"". The teams reconnoitre these sectors, compiling notes about them. This valuable information enables the co-driver to tell the driver what lies ahead.

So we asked Miles Jacobson, Studio Director at SI Games, to take us through some of the changes you'll want to hear about most...  Transfer Center - A new way of managing all current transfer and loan bids for your club, both incoming and outgoing, making it easier to compare bids and reject or accept them.  Finance Revamp - Sports Interactive have updated the finance area of Football Manager 2008 to better reflect the ever-changing modern football world. More information is available to the manager too, including, but not limited to, corporate matchday income, season ticket news, investment funds, improved sponsorships, collective win bonuses and the ability to move around funds from the wage budget and transfer budget (and vice versa) at any point to help you in your quest for the ideal squad.  International Management - The international management gameplay has been completely revamped for Football Manager 2008, including, but not limited to, media improvements, international retirements, player interaction, international scouting, improved national pool selection, captain selection and a separation of international and club morale for players.  Match Flow - The largest change to matchdays in a Sports Interactive game since the introduction of the 2D match engine. Match flow brings more atmosphere to matchdays with match previews, team talks, opposition player instructions, the match itself, half time and post match now seamlessly following on from one another. There's no more pausing to make tactical changes and you'll find a mini-radar pitch whilst making those tactical changes to keep you in touch with what's going on in the match.  Confidence - You can now easily tell what your board and supporters think about your performance in the game through the new confidence section. This gives you feedback not just on your current progress in competitions, but also your financial management and signings.  Easier to Use - A much cleaner skin, a brand new advisor system to help you through various areas of the game, a new notes and notebook system, better button positioning for simpler navigation and an updated tutorial and manual. Also, coach reports to make taking over a new team easier and a new calendar system - which lists all important dates throughout the season - help to make Football Manager 2008 the easiest Sports Interactive game to use yet.  Fan Days - The board can now arrange fan days to boost ailing attendances, or for matches that are likely to attract a low crowd, with a long-term affect to attendances if all goes well.   Awards Overhaul - A full overhaul of the awards system inside the game, which is not only more accurate but also includes new awards, such as the European golden boot and a 'best eleven', which shows the all-time (in-game) best XI for all teams and nations.  Match Engine Improvements - A greatly improved match engine, once again utilizing the footballing brain of Ray Houghton and other tools used by real-life managers, to make the most accurate simulation of football in a computer game even more like-life than ever before. Oh, and the ability to change the pitch dimensions at the start of the season to suit your style of play better.  Expanded Media - More media and feedback than ever before, plus more detail in existing media, and a new competition news section to find out what major things are going on in all league competitions.  Regenerated Player Photos - All in-game regenerated players now have pictures using FaceGen technology to give each player more personality. This gives the ability for players to be seen to mature and grow-up looks-wise in front of your eyes as the game is going on.  Speedyfastier - Saving and loading is now significantly faster, with network gaming quicker and smoother to play, as well as tactical changes and match reports being faster than ever before.

The gripping storyline foreshadows the events that will take place in the Forgotten Realms with the coming of release this June of the Fourth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game.
In the aftermath of the defeat of the King of Shadows, the Sword Coast is in the midst of an uneasy economic recovery. Trade syndicates have sprung up to exploit the post-war confusion for their own ends. The player’s party will wade into this uncertain environment; in order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through Faerûn by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. As they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new faction working behind the scenes: the evil, shapeshifting, serpentine Yuan-Ti.
In addition to trading and economic manipulation, the Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map allows players to explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the Neverwinter Nights games. Exploration will take players from well-known locations, like Neverwinter and Crossroad Keep, to more exotic areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of Samarach. Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become. The 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.
Fans of the compelling multiplayer features of Neverwinter Nights 2 will also be able to take advantage of new improvements to the multiplayer experience, while modders will be able to take advantage of the power and flexibility of the Overland Map and Trading System features along with other world-building enhancements.

Travel the Sword Coast and Samarach using the open ended exploration of the new Overland Map.  Use skills like Spot and Survival while on the Overland Map to avoid ambushes and even find hidden locales and lost artifacts.
Create your own full party of adventurers. Devastate your foes with a squad of fireball-flinging Sorcerers, form a solid wall of steel with a party of Fighters, or strike the perfect balance in your party by spreading out the classes you choose for your characters.
Improved party gameplay including streamlined party conversations, a new Teamwork Benefit System, and powerful party feats.
The world's economy reacts to your adventures and choices. And, through trading and quests, you can expand your merchant company into a massive trading empire.

Looting
In Opulencia, looting is what makes the world go round. If you’re not spending your every waking moment obsessed with the size of your treasure pile, then your neighbors will think something’s very wrong with you. At the center of every castle lies its crowning jewel, the overflowing treasure room.
Defense
Start by creating the perfect castle layout, using the tons of available room combinations (it’s a lot, we did the math). Next, you’ll want to fill your new creation with hordes of loyal minions, ranging from fuzzy baby spiders to kill-crazy giant Cyclopses (or is it Cyclopi?). Don’t forget to liberally apply a healthy dose of devious traps to achieve that extra layer of deadliness.

The game is inspired by popular pulp fiction stories set during World War II, and delves into the key events and characters behind historic battles. Its scenario tells of a shady third party pulling the strings to orchestrate the war, using futuristic technology to advance the carnage for their own ends. Players compete in both turn based and also real time strategy battles, plotting moves and attacks in the turn based section and getting hands on by switching to the real time combat mode where they’ll be in charge of firing and reloading the weapons. The emphasis is not on trying to blast everything that moves however, as the player will often leave their vessels exposed and in significant danger. Keeping the right ships afloat is key, as the player will need certain craft to enable to them gain new bases and increase their fleet and others, like Submarines, to take out the heavyweight attack carriers of your enemy. As you would expect with a game of this nature, it’s perfect for two-player action and the wireless connections of both machines enables friends to compete against each other. With 20 single player missions to take on and the option to customise the player’s own flagship, there’s plenty to get stuck into.

This Is the Police is a strategy/adventure game set in a city spiraling the drain. You’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg as gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd (portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem).
Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigues. You are taking the role of Police Chief Jack Boyd – you’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack see his retirement with a nice sum of money waiting to be spend or will he end up broken … or even worse?
Immerse yourself in a controversial tale of corruption, crime, and political intrigue. Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.
Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg? Or will you land yourself behind bars — or worse?











Your mission is clear: Make 500.000$ in 180 days, before Jack Boyd goes to retirement. How? Up to you!
Decisions, decisions, decisions – This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, it will influence your game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.
The Good, the Bad … the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg’s Police Department is dealing with all kind of people. It is up to you, to sort out the bad boys.
Follow your duties: As head of Freeburg PD, Jack has to take care of the daily routine – responding to emergencies, managing his officers, fighting for budget …
Start and solve Investigations and get evidence against the criminal gangs in Freeburg.
Deal with the different powers of the city: The Mayor, the Mafia, the Church, the Labor Union: everyone offers you a favor, but everything has its price …
Rich and fully voice acted story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by the glorious Jon St. John (aka the voice of Duke Nukem)
