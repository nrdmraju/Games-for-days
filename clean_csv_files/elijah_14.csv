But some travel into the wilderness, seeking fortune. One such pair is Geoff and Vasily,who act as bodyguards for a young explorer, diving into mines overflowing with dangerous creatures.
These  explorers, known as Bergmans, long ago gained control of mines  throughout the wilderness, claiming the precious ore buried within and  using it to power the last human city and provide a peaceful life for  its more affluent citizens.
But even now, they clash with the  beasts of the wilderness, and must use whatever precious resources they  can scavenge to protect their city.
Geoff, meanwhile, dreams of  proving his worth and earning citizenship of his own. But he would soon  discover that life wasn't as simple as he once thought.
It began  suddenly - selection and survival. Alliances were tested, strained,  broken. The world was changing, evolving, and Geoff would stand as a  central figure in the upheaval.
He would have to confront... the Natural Doctrine.

Firefighter F.D.18 pushes the PlayStation®2's graphic capabilities to its limits and captures all the realism and experiences of real life firefighters.
Set in a huge city, the game follows firefighter Dean McGregor as he becomes embroiled in a complex mystery involving the random eruption of fires within some of the area's largest buildings. Also covering the fires is TV news reporter Emilie Arvin, and as the game progresses the unlikely pair finds themselves working side by side as they seek out the perpetrator behind the blazes.
Viewed in the third-person, Firefighter F.D. 18's camera system trails McGregor as he enters the burning locations searching for trapped survivors and attempts to put the fires out. Players are introduced to the danger firefighters face every day as chemicals explode, backdrafts show their devastating force and flashovers threaten the life of McGregor and those he is attempting to rescue. The game also forces the player to think quickly using hoses, axes and additional equipment to extinguish the fires.

Assume the role of one of five heroes, and  hack, slash, smash , burn and pierce the vile Skaven using a multitude  of weapons. Fight your way through the city of Ubersreik, from the top  of the Magnus Tower to the bowels of the Under Empire.

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Just then, something falls out of the sky and hits him on the head. Instead of raining raindrops, the sky is raining raingear! So Sam the Lion and Reader Rabbit climb into their fabulous Dreamship and soar up into the sky. They follow the path of falling raingear to Cloud Nine, where they meet Queen Cumulus, queen of the Cloud People.
Queen Cumulus explains that a steady stream of raingear is being thrown onto Cloud Nine. The raingear has formed a pile so tall that it is starting to topple over—causing raingear to fall down onto Wordville. The queen thinks the raingear is coming from a funny island below Cloud Nine. So Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion zoom to the island in the Dreamship to check it out.
Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion discover that the island is full of strange trees that grow raingear. The island is called Raingear Island, and it’s the home of Irvin the Inventor. Irvin hates rain, so he invented a machine that throws raingear at the clouds to make them go away. But when Irvin hears how much trouble the raingear is causing, he agrees to turn off his machine.
There’s just one problem. To turn off his machine, Irvin needs three things—a big, round, purple hoop; a bag of extra-stretchy, jumbo rubber bands; and an extra-soft, double-stuffed feather pillow. But he doesn’t have any of the three.
Can you help Reader Rabbit and Sam the Lion explore Cloud Nine and Raingear Island in search of the things that Irvin needs? If you find the three items and bring them back to Irvin, he will turn off his machine and stop the avalanche of raingear. But don’t delay—the pile of raingear is getting bigger by the minute. If you wait too long, it might topple over and bury Wordville!

Sumio Mondo is a professional “searcher” who is hired to avert an impending plane crash with tragic consequences in the adventure game Flower, Sun and Rain on Nintendo DS. After failing to defuse the bomb that destroys the aeroplane once, Sumio discovers he‘s caught in a continuous timeloop where he’s forced to try and prevent the disaster over and over again. The question is – can he succeed before completely losing his sanity?
Take a trip to Lospass Island and help Sumio retain his grip on reality as the surrounds of the Flower, Sun and Rain hotel get decidedly more bizarre by the day. In order to unravel the mysteries that plague the island, you’ll encounter a whole range of characters with tricky problems that need solving. From a wrestler who needs to regain his form, to a girl who’s lost her little pink pet, the obstacles are eclectic, often eccentric, but always amusing. Despite the serious theme, Flower, Sun and Rain is infused with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour that never takes itself too seriously and will have adventure fans chuckling knowingly throughout.
Many of the puzzles are solved by means of a leather briefcase called Catherine (of course), which can be plugged into virtually any device and manipulated via the Touch Screen. Put your thinking cap on and get ready to crack some codes, because that’s the only way you’re going to get closer to the answer! Flower, Sun and Rain features bright, stylized graphics that transport you instantly to the heat of the tropical Lospass Island and an engrossing soundtrack.

Visit Lospass Island, the place where time stands still for Sumio Mondo.

飲酒量ゲージと飲酒力レベルにご注意を。 画 面右上の飲酒量ゲージは、あなたの飲酒量に比例して上昇していきます。ゲージが一定以上たまると、あなたはほろ酔い状態となり、あなたの視界 (画面) に変化が現れます。ゲージ MAX まで上昇すると、酩酊状態となり強制的に退店となりますので、お酒はほどほどに。これらドリンク強度 (アルコール度数) と飲んだ量により経験値がたまり、一定量を超えればあなたの飲酒力レベルが上がっていきます。また、ホストガールにご馳走してあげるドリンクは、彼女たちそれぞれの好みのドリンクをオーダーすれば、好感度にも影響があるかもしれませんよ!?

飲み物やおつまみをオーダーしてください! 当店では様々なメニューを取り揃えて、お客様をお待ちしています。どんどんオーダーくださいね。お各様がお酒やおつまみをたくさんオーダーして頂ければ、ホストガール達もきっと喜ぶことでしょう。 特定のおつまみには楽しいゲームタイムがついてくるかもしれません。

A massive nuclear fireball explodes high in the night sky, marking the dramatic beginning to the Third Tiberium War and long-awaited return of the most groundbreaking Real-time Strategy franchise (RTS) of all time. In 2047, Tiberium has blanketed the Earth, which is now divided into zones based on the level of Tiberium infestation. Pristine Blue Zones represent 20% of the planet's surface and are the last refuge of the civilized world. Partially habitable Yellow Zones make up 50% of the planet's surface; most of the world's population lives in these war-torn and ecologically ravaged areas. The remaining 30% of the planet is uninhabitable, a Tiberium wasteland swept by violent Ion Storms. Red Zones are like the surface of an Alien planet. The infamous Kane has returned to lead the Brotherhood of Nod in a massive global assault on the Global Defense Initiative and the few remaining Blue zones left on the planet. Only you can stop him. The fate of humanity - and the planet - is in your hands.

With moves so easy to perform, you can concentrate on solving the crazy puzzles.

Crafty designers have built the game with several routes to choose from throughout Helmet Chaos, so you'll want to explore to plunder its secrets.

Set during the 1920s, Call of Cthulhu is based                              on the Cthulhu Mythos of HP Lovecraft, an American writer                              of fantasy and horror and is produced in conjunction                              with the developers of the Call of Cthulhu pen and paper                              RPG, Chaosium Inc.

Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action. Along with the new missions, the game features an enhanced engine, advanced AI, and even more authenticity than before.
Gameplay:A War Game, sequel to the original.

Features:
 New conflicts and enemies to face: Call of Duty 2 brings you bigger battles, with more tanks, troops, and explosions on-screen, and bigger scope, with a wide range of locales and environments across the European Theater. Fight ""The Desert Fox"" across the scorching sands of North Africa as wave upon wave of tanks clash in the desert. 
 Use rocket-propelled grappling hooks alongside your Army Ranger squad to storm and scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc against a relentless German counterassault, and slog through urban chaos as a tank hunter in war-torn Russia. Rely on your squad as never before: The dozens of Allied soldiers surrounding you are fully aware of the changing situations around them, and will let you know using an all-new, context-sensitive battle chatter system. They will draw enemy fire, lay down cover for you, use foxholes and moving tanks for cover, and warn you of incoming enemy troops and hostile fire. 
 Choice-based gameplay: Play through missions in the order you see fit. Will you decide to play first as a sniper or as a tank commander? It’s your call. Open-ended battlefields allow you to individualize your tactics and choose the order in which you complete your objectives. 
 Multiplayer Mayhem: Go online for intense Axis vs. Allies team-based multiplayer action, building on the hugely popular Call of Duty multiplayer modes.

When he suddenly loses contact with his squad, it is evident that the simulator has gone wrong and must immediately locate him missing team and get to the cause of the problem. It quickly becomes evident that hackers have taken over the simulation and infected with a virus that has corrupted the system, mutated enemies and turned the internal defences of the training program onto the Spec Ops unit themselves. With the virus running ragged through the three main gameplay worlds that make up the 15 levels, there is a huge amount of interaction to be had with the environments. Players can hack into turrets, terminals and doors to gain access to new areas or gain themselves valuable breathing space. Weapons, armour and abilities can be upgraded as well as collecting more experimental weapons affected by the virus like the Data Leech. All the while the player is communicating with the Military Command HQ who hosted the training until the hackers took over as both parties try to escape the disease infecting the system. Improved graphics, tighter gameplay and a fantastic eight-player multiplayer option featuring adhoc or infrastructure modes gives huge gameplay variety on specially created deathmatch levels.

The arrival of this unmistakably Japanese offering was greeted with unprecedented levels of excitement in the office when the quote on the front of the box was read aloud by staff writer and self-proclaimed pinball sim pro Dan Maher: ""Flipnic is an enjoyable simple-action amazing pinball game for you"". And UbiSoft's delightfully surreal game is just that, a wonderfully entertaining slice of ball-flipping action that anyone can enjoy.
The first thing you'll notice when you get your mitts on Flipnic is just how huge the 'tables' are. Based on five different themes, including Jungle, Techno and Metal, these unique worlds contain stunning landscapes, complete with their own individual wildlife, flora and fauna. The first set of tables has a lush tropical look, with butterflies floating over the game as you frantically bash buttons in an attempt to achieve Flipnic's surreal objectives. The challenges include saving pink flamingos from the jaws of hungry crocodiles, destroying UFOs, and feeding hungry monkeys by knocking bananas into their waiting paws. And when you're not putting your mean pinballing skills to the test in single-player mode, you can also throw down the gauntlet to friends in multiplayer modes, with Pinball Soccer and Pinball Basketball available for two-player action. Possibly the most surreal addition to the genre, Flipnic sports beautifully vibrant graphics, intuitive controls, and some of the best ball physics you'll ever encounter in a pinball sim "

Even with most of the options available to PC chess players, 14 skill levels to choose from, and animated fight scenes for the kiddies, the 3D view's lack of visual clarity makes for a frustrating game.Virtual Chess offers most of the options computerized chess should. For the novice, there's a simple but thorough tutorial. Broken up into slim chapters, it's easy to use, whether you're just verifying the rules for taking pawns ""en passant,"" or trying queenside castling for the first time. A save-game feature allows you to see just how stupid a move is before committing to it permanently. Unfortunately, there's no option to just retake the last move, so if you're hesitant, save early and save often. If you're still feeling squeamish, there's an onscreen CPU next-move suggestion button available at all times. Play in Virtual Chess is plain hard to see. The pieces are difficult to tell apart from any angle, so you've got to be extra careful to avoid stupid mistakes (or be surprised when the enemy ""king"" easily avoids check by sliding across the entire board). To this end, plan on spending a lot of time rotating the board, which turns a full 360 degrees horizontally or vertically. If you were some kind of crazy nut, you could even attempt to play looking at the felt on the bottom of the board. Unfortunately, the board only spins on either axis in one direction, so if you miss your spot, you have to go all the way around again. Thankfully, a 2D version is also included, but that removes the whole point of the game: the fight animations.The game would be better off without them anyway. Had they occurred on the regular playing screen, that would have been one thing. Such is not the case. Every time a piece is captured, all the pieces shoot into the air, the screen goes all crazy, and... the board appears again, with a cutscene featuring stylized representations of the capturing piece and its victim squared off to fight. The black knight is a battering ram, the white a unicorn. The black bishop is some sort of mosquito creature, the white a wizard. The black queen is overweight. Yawn. The animations are jerky and slow and lose their appeal after the third time or so. Thankfully, they may be turned off.Ever since R2D2 and Chewbacca first played their first near-deadly game of holographic chess (""Let the wookie win""), it's seemed like a good idea to offer a chess simulation that comes equipped with 3D fighting sequences for the captures - and this did prove somewhat successful with Empire Interactive's Combat Chess for the PC. Unless the fighting actually occurs fully rendered using the same engine as the rest of the game, rather than as an annoyingly distracting cutscene, the novelty will always fade fast. Masters and novices alike will probably quickly strip Virtual Chess down to its clearer, more practical 2D mode after a minimum of laughs are achieved from the fights. Even in this mode, the game provides a great tool for fans of the ""real thing"" of any skill level. "

The Zed outbreak caused by Horzine  Biotech’s failed experiments has quickly spread with unstoppable  momentum, paralyzing the European Union. Only a month ago, the first Zed  outbreak from the original KILLING FLOOR ripped through London; now the  specimen clones are everywhere. Civilization is in disarray,  communication networks have failed, governments have collapsed, and  military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of  Europe are now focused on self-preservation, the lucky few who survived  having gone into hiding.
But  not all have given up hope; a motley group of civilians, soldiers, and  mercenaries have banded together to fight the outbreaks from privately  funded bases across Europe.  When a specimen clone outbreak is detected,  the players are sent into Zed-laden hot zones to exterminate all  threats using whatever means necessary.

After proving popular in the previous titles in which it has  appeared, Survival Mode returns with more features than ever before.  While the core concept of completing objectives as you ascend to the  castle's higher levels remains, a new, shorter way to play has also been  added, in which you must clear certain challenges in a limited time.  You must weigh the risks of continuing to progress through the castle  with the greater rewards that await you if you succeed.

Furthermore, the event scenes that are the backbone of the story,  along with the background environments, camerawork and effects have  increased the dramatic aspects of the game to allow for a story with  even more passion and depth.

Receiving no response, Ivy sets off through a dreamy forest, meeting many birds but none who share her resemblance. As she wanders, she stumbles upon a single glowing red feather and the first clue of her mother’s whereabouts. Presented in a beguiling storybook-like art style, Ivy the Kiwi? utilizes a unique control scheme on both the DS and Wii to guide Ivy through her daunting journey. Ivy moves back and forth freely and independently of the player through timed 2-D side-view landscapes, and is guided by the use of vines created and controlled by either the stylus or Wii Remote™ as players aim to collect more orange feathers through the stages to boost their overall score. These stretchy vines herd Ivy forward, upstairs, over walls and dangerous spikes and other menacing obstacles. Multiple vines may be created and used in conjunction, and an existing vine can be pulled in a slingshot motion to propel flightless Ivy skyward or forward as a projectile to drill through barriers and enemies. Vines bend and flex with the motion of the stylus or Wii Remote, but pulled too far and they snap! Ivy the Kiwi? features over 100 hundred stages for both the DS and Wii versions. In addition to the single-player storyline, up to four players can compete using a single-card via local wireless connection on DS or in split-screen mode on Wii. Currently in production, Ivy the Kiwi? will be released in North America by XSEED Games on DS and Wii during Summer 2010.

You arrive on the island with a cue in hand and a severe lack of funds; one trip to the isle's loan shark (and we do mean shark) later and you're given enough to help you enter local competitions. By winning games and placing side bets, you'll steadily climb the ranks and earn yourself enough cash to pay off your debts and unlock new equipment, minigames and crazy tables.
Pool Paradise challenges you to master all of the standard pool rule sets, both UK and US, including 8 ball, 9 ball and 15 ball, as well as some unorthodox new games such as Bowlliards and Switchball. If you've earned enough cash and you fancy a break from the baize, you can play a quick round of darts, traditional funfair game Skeeball, try your luck on the Coconut Shy or even play Archer's own Defender-style classic Dropzone.

Close-quarter battles: Maps in narrow corridors with non-linear level design challenge even the most tactical of gamers, increasing the importance of the infamous one-shot kill.

The game is set in the last years of the roaring 1960s, a time of Sex, Drugs and Rock 'N Roll. The biker movement, rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in 'Ride to Hell'
 
Action loaded from the very start with free roaming environments, players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America. Protecting their turf, their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game will involve.
 
'Ride to Hell' is not for the faint hearted; it's aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture. With its hard drinking, bare knuckle environment, this is as close to the action as you can get.

On April 26, 1986, the world's worst nuclear accident occurred: Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl power station exploded, releasing clouds of radioactive matter. Soviet authorities established a 30km 'Exclusion Zone' around this nuclear wasteland, but in 2006 a second explosion rocked the stricken reactor, obliterating all living things and causing the Zone's boundaries to ripple outwards. From this epicenter came waves of mutated creatures, deadly radiation, and a strange, anomalous energy. The Zone was cordoned off by the military, who would shoot on sight anyone foolish enough to brave the horrors within.
It is now 2012 - man has ventured further and further into the heart of the Zone driven by reports of strange 'artifacts' imbued with anomalous energy. Mercenaries and bounty hunters compete to recover these artifacts, which command extortionate prices on the black market. Others seek to find the truth behind the Zone, while some merely revel in the desolate lawlessness of the place. Whatever their motivation, over time these individuals - Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killer, Explorers and Robbers - have become known as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s.
Awakening in the Zone, you are one such S.T.A.L.K.E.R., fighting for survival in this man-made Hell, while trying to discover the truth behind Chernobyl's sinister past and ominous future.

An immersive storyline seamlessly blended with a living, breathing, non-linear open-world environment governed by the revolutionary 'A-Life' system

The ""Black Evil"" has taken over this lush and colorful land and has captured the once happy natives -- the Maboo tribe. Players have the ability to defeat the ""Black Evil,"" take back the land and return it to the Maboo tribe. To do so, gamers use their imagination to create their own monster - using a nearly infinite number of possibilities - and enter it in a series of competitions involving timing, speed and head-tohead battles. To the victor goes the magical orbs that hold the power of the island and the key to returning the peace and prosperity to Amazing Island.
Gameplay:Amazing Island is a monster trainer/breeder game -- one that's more creatively restrictive than Magic Pengel, yet looks to offer a more thorough gameplay experience. As often happens in these games, an evil force has descended on the island, endangering its native tribes. Luckily for the natives, this is the sort of evil that can be defeated by entering your custom kaiju (monster) into water-skipping competitions, foot-races, GBA-based card battles, and other assorted mini-challenges
Features:
Amazing Island offers roughly 30 types of challenges where victory gains the player magic orbs and hundreds of new monster-modification options. 
The creature creation/editing process involves players adding video game ""flesh"" to a variety of skeletal types, and the resulting creations can look very impressive. 
The game engine automatically smoothes the outlines of ""flesh"" drawn by the player, and manufactures a fully 3D creature that looks at home in its video game environments. 
Unlockable skins and objects allow for outlandish creatures adorned with shimmering scales, wings, Viking-horned helmets, rotating police-style ""bubble flashers,"" and many others

On the war-torn planets of tomorrow, mankind's greatest battle is about to begin. With its frontier colonies devastated by a growing insurrection, Earth dispatches the elite 8th Armored Infantry (nicknamed ""Section 8™"") to repel the coming onslaught.
The nickname refers to an old United States military regulation where a soldier would be dismissed from service through being mentally unfit for duty. The near-suicidal missions that this division volunteers for brands them as insane by other military units.
Section 8 deploys by 'burning in' from their orbital drop ships tens of thousands of feet above the battlefield, utilizing the most advanced arsenal of military hardware known to man. Their mission: to scout and secure difficult objectives and smash enemy defenses in lightning-quick assaults.
An intense first-person shooter, Section 8 allows players to dynamically alter the flow of combat as they see fit. Employing tactical assets and on-demand vehicle deliveries, players are given unprecedented strategic control over epic sci-fi battlefields.
Get ready to burn-in trooper; the war begins in 2009.

Uncover the  chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a  world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within  Lovecraft’s iconic universe.
The Cthulhu Mythos has been  fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the  largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless  stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original  publication of H.P. Lovecraft’s The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and  references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very  beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human  psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos  to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
In  this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow,  all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange  creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos,  intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of  everything.
Your mind will suffer - balancing a razor-thin line  between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you  question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Creeping  shadows hide lurking figures… and all the while, the Great Dreamer  prepares for his awakening.

Still  it comes as a shock when he is summoned to his family’s ancestral home  in the Scottish highlands, after his father has taken his own life  there. David does not know much about his father’s final weeks, but the  circumstances of his death seem more than peculiar. Settling the  heritage is merely an excuse for David to find out more about the castle  his father grew up in, meeting the family he never knew and for  shedding light on the mysteries surrounding his father’s death.
Tormented by nightmares and waking dreams for all his life, he fears  that it might be his destiny to follow in his father’s footsteps, down a  path that leads to madness and death. Is there really a curse that has been haunting his family for  generations as his father believed? Or are the mysteries hidden inside  the cold walls of Black Mirror house of a far more wordly nature?
It is up to David to uncover the horrible truths, buried under generations of silence and fathoms of stone.

The graphics, although some of the most stylish on PSP, have also improved with some impressive new techniques enabling incredibly atmospheric lighting effects and crisp, colourful animations. Perhaps the biggest addition is the two-player co-operative mode that now been added. Once the host player has selected either DJ or Pandora, the second player can pick from a raft of new playable characters and into the game they go. The beauty of this mode is that the game has been tweaked to incorporate two players, so enemies are tougher as there are two people attacking them! Effectively, it’s almost an entirely different game as you must use teamwork and different attack plans to progress. The creativity used throughout the game also continues to impress – there are a huge variety of different levels to play through ranging from your standard forest levels through to a stage made entirely of food.

Marchtown has always been a town in which Drum Majors are adored.  One young boy, Major Minor, wanted more then anything to become the world's greatest Drum Major and he would stop at nothing to reach his goal. But something was missing.... He needed band members and instruments to start a marching band.  Once he inherited the Magic Baton from his great grandmother he was ready to begin recruiting members for his band. Can Major Minor fulfill his potential and share the joy of marching with the world?

Major Minor's Majestic March marks the return of the creative team behind the renowned PaRappa the Rapper franchise--legendary game designer and multimedia musician Masaya Matsuura and famed New York artist Rodney Alan Greenblat.
Your Wii Remote is Major Minor's ""special"" bandleader baton, used to keep tempo, recruit new band members and pick-up valuable items. If your rhythm is unstable confusion will result; band members will drop out and you could ultimately fail the stage.
March in 7 different whimsical locations. Use your best efforts to create the most impressive parade ever while nimbly avoiding obstacles.
Recruit up to 30 original characters for your band by using the Wii Remote to attract them to the parade. Each player moves at different speeds so it's important to maintain the best rhythm for the overall procession to ensure the highest score for each stage.
Add 20+ different instruments to your procession, from brass to woodwinds to percussion. 
As the makeup of the band changes, so does the performance; it all depends on which members you select! Try different combinations each time you play.
Use your whistle to manage the procession when obstacles appear in your path. Train tracks, suspension bridges, a road race, even political rallies can affect a smooth performance that might disperse your band should panic and confusion result.
Numerous modes of play include:
Single Player--progresses the overall game storyline as you play.
Cooperative Multiplayer Mode--Play together with a friend to build and maintain the band! 
Contest Multiplayer Mode--Compete to see who can amass the largest procession
March and keep tempo to more than 20 well-known marching band tunes from around the world, composed into original medleys for each unique stage.
Dazzle the crowd with your incredible baton-twirling displays during Drill Mode.
Unlock new characters, difficulty levels, multiplayer and so much more!
