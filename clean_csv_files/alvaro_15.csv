Beyond Earth extended the Civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction.
After the first wave of great colony ships departed Earth, the jubilation of humanity was short-lived. Those left behind fell into a violent struggle over the quickly-diminishing resources on their barren home world. From this tumultuous time, four new factions arose. These newcomers were grounded not in the idealism of their predecessors, but on opportunism, resilience, ruthlessness, and above all a commitment to their own survival.
Now, many decades after their first landfall on a new planet, the proud survivors of the first expeditions beyond Earth look up to see the skies darkened by a new breed of pioneers.
Beyond Earth extended the Civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction. Rising Tide extends Beyond Earth to new frontiers on the planet’s surface and beneath its seas, adding even more choices and diplomatic options as you continue to build “just one more turn” toward a new vision for the future of humanity.

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Overview
It’s the last stop.  The final destination. The BIG SHOW. It’s where dreams born in backyards are finally realized. Where the fences are FARTHER.  The grandstands are LARGER. And the spotlight is BRIGHTER. It’s where thieves run FASTER, pitchers throw HARDER and the sluggers go DEEPER. Where the bats are BIGGER, the spikes are SHARPER and the comebacks are harder to swallow. It’s where home runs are RUTHIAN and fastballs CATCH FIRE. It’s where a monster lurks in left. Where bombers terrorize the night. And where the confines aren’t always so friendly. It’s THE BIGS. And everything about them just got BIGGER.

After the turmoil caused by the assault on Lunapolis which sparked  the ""Blissful Death Wars"" (as depicted in the previous instalment),  peace seems to have been restored, with the legendary DonPachi Corps  retreating to its HQ in a space-time fold. Six years later, anomalies  are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of  order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and  time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Longhena  Gottvin dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.
Nevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly,  discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and  is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to  the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. Unsettled,  the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to  fight back the invasion before future changes.
Once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the  fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal:  the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are waiting...
The bee is still humming.
DoDonPachi Resurrection takes the DonPachi Corps back into the  action. Players will have the task of fighting hundreds of enemies while  dodging thousands of bullets in this renowned bullet hell title. Dash  from enemy to enemy to string together long combos and  send your score  into the stratosphere!

The Xbox 360 release is a  deluxe edition featuring three different modes of gameplay and the  game's soundtrack on a separate disc.

Manage your café, explore the world, and raise your very own dragon in…   Little Dragons Café!
Aksys Games is excited to announce that Little Dragons Café,  the  latest tour de’ force by renowned game designer Yasuhiro Wada will  be  coming to the Nintendo Switch™ and the PlayStation®4 system on  August  24, 2018!

Over his  twenty years in the game industry, he has also collaborated  with other  designers on titles such as Deadly Premonition.
""Wada and I have been friends for a decade, and we’ve discussed  teaming  up on a new IP for about half that time,” says Akibo Shieh,  founder  and CEO of Aksys Games, “It wasn’t until Little Dragons Café  that our  schedules finally lined up so we were able to work together on a   project, and the game has been in development for two years now.""
The story begins with a twin brother and sister learning to cook and   manage a small café under their mother’s tutelage. All was peaceful and   routine until one morning when the twins discover that their mother has   fallen into a deep sleep and won’t wake up. Suddenly, a strange old  man  appears to inform them that they must raise a dragon in order to  save  her life. Working together with three quirky café employees, the  two  siblings must figure out how to a wrangle a dragon and manage the  family  business while finding a way to save their mother.

After discovering that the girl is being hunted by  ghostly creatures, he embarks on his own journey into the mysterious  world of rain to save her. Upon entering the world he discovers that he  has also become invisible and he must learn to navigate through the  unknown, using the rain to guide and protect him.
Throughout rain,  players control the invisible boy, leveraging the unique ability to  appear in the rain and disappear under cover to advance through the  storyline. However, just like in the real world, players must understand  that at times what they are able to see isn’t everything and they must  use their imagination to interact with the environment and solve  puzzles, and to help them along their journey to safety.
The world  of rain is shaped by introducing a unique and harmonious blend of vivid  fantasy artwork and realistic images. Combined with the expressive  sound of falling rain, splashing water and the reflective nature of  puddles as the invisible boy passes through, the game is designed to  awaken the sense of uncertainty and solitude inherent in every player.

The plot revolves around Princess Shizu, a young woman who is married to a cruel warlord named Lord Hakkaku. After an attempt on her life, she is discovered by Rikimaru and Ayama of the Azuma Shinobi Ryu ninja clan. They vow to protect her from further harm and discover the identity of her mysterious assailant.
Gameplay:Tenchu: Dark Secret places you in the Tabi boots of a pair of ninja assassins who must protect the life of a princess. Stalk your enemies with sword in hand, plant traps in the underbrush or strike with an assortment of realistic ninja weaponry—the choice is yours. With more than 40 single-player missions and the ability to construct your own weapons and items, Tenchu is sure to keep your sword hand busy for a long time.   You look down on your missions with a overhead view. All the action occurs on the top screen, and the bottom screen contains a map and shows which special item you have selected. As an enemy comes within your range, he appears on the map. From there, you can determine what pattern he moves in and plot your attack from there.   There are several ways to perform a kill an assassin would love. The safest is to set a bamboo trap. Using your stealth, sneak around the enemy's route and plant the trap in his path. Then clear out of the area. Once the trap goes off, you're safe to go back to the area and take any items the enemy drops.   You can kill enemies in any number of ways, but you'll score the big points through stealth kills and combos. Combo Kills, Stealth and Damage Taken are three of the five areas where your score will really fluctuate. You can replay a level to try to get a perfect score.  Prove your ninjapo skills by challenging friends to a local wireless multiplayer match. Tenchu: Dark Secret boasts three unique modes and a whole host of options to keep each match fresh and fun. Whether you're creeping through a bamboo forest to plunge a blade into your friend's back or setting a trap to steal his precious dumplings, you're going to need a towel to wipe the sweat from your hands.

Receiving no response, Ivy sets off through a dreamy forest, meeting many birds but none who share her resemblance. As she wanders, she stumbles upon a single glowing red feather and the first clue of her mother’s whereabouts. Presented in a beguiling storybook-like art style, Ivy the Kiwi? utilizes a unique control scheme on both the DS and Wii to guide Ivy through her daunting journey. Ivy moves back and forth freely and independently of the player through timed 2-D side-view landscapes, and is guided by the use of vines created and controlled by either the stylus or Wii Remote™ as players aim to collect more orange feathers through the stages to boost their overall score. These stretchy vines herd Ivy forward, upstairs, over walls and dangerous spikes and other menacing obstacles. Multiple vines may be created and used in conjunction, and an existing vine can be pulled in a slingshot motion to propel flightless Ivy skyward or forward as a projectile to drill through barriers and enemies. Vines bend and flex with the motion of the stylus or Wii Remote, but pulled too far and they snap! Ivy the Kiwi? features over 100 hundred stages for both the DS and Wii versions. In addition to the single-player storyline, up to four players can compete using a single-card via local wireless connection on DS or in split-screen mode on Wii. Currently in production, Ivy the Kiwi? will be released in North America by XSEED Games on DS and Wii during Summer 2010.

But some travel into the wilderness, seeking fortune. One such pair is Geoff and Vasily,who act as bodyguards for a young explorer, diving into mines overflowing with dangerous creatures.
These  explorers, known as Bergmans, long ago gained control of mines  throughout the wilderness, claiming the precious ore buried within and  using it to power the last human city and provide a peaceful life for  its more affluent citizens.
But even now, they clash with the  beasts of the wilderness, and must use whatever precious resources they  can scavenge to protect their city.
Geoff, meanwhile, dreams of  proving his worth and earning citizenship of his own. But he would soon  discover that life wasn't as simple as he once thought.
It began  suddenly - selection and survival. Alliances were tested, strained,  broken. The world was changing, evolving, and Geoff would stand as a  central figure in the upheaval.

Highlights include the sun drenched Lake Johnson in  Florida and the glacial Lake Boulder in upstate New York, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. Of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and Fishing Sim World features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, Bass Cat Boats. Drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your Sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

Other  highlights include France’s famous Gigantica Main Lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘Fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. That’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the UK’s Grand Union Canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
Fishing Sim World launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique AI and  behavioural systems. To help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. Target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from Duckett Fishing and  Fitzgerald Fishing. Equip your reels with line from Fitzgerald or  Sunline and select the correct lures or baits from Nichols Lures,  Missile Baits and Bill Lewis (Rat-L-Trap). Target carp with equipment  from leading names including Korda, RidgeMonkey, Mainline Baits and  Delkim.
Not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. You will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
Fishing Sim World reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. Featuring the launch of ‘The Dovetail  Fishing League’ (DFL) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘Angler  of the Month.’ The DFL consists of multiple events split across four  different series. Each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  Global Season Leaderboard. Players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for PC), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on Steam and voice  chat for console.
So  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the USA, spinning for a monster  pike in England, or sat by the side of a peaceful French carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
Fishing  Sim World will be available to buy on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam  (PC) from 18th September. In the meantime, explore the Fishing Sim  World hub on Dovetail Live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

LEGO The Hobbit allows gamers to play through their favorite scenes from the films, following the hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he is recruited by the wizard Gandalf to aid Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves. Bilbo leaves the comforts of the Shire on a journey through Middle-earth to help the Dwarves reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor within the Lonely Mountain. Along the way, he is introduced to ravenous Trolls, dangerous Orcs and, of course, Gollum and his precious ring. Players must use the Dwarves’ unique combination of abilities – often with hilarious results – to solve the most exciting and varied quests of any LEGO video game to date.

The ambush was set up by the pesky pirates, who desperately want to capture the Dreamship. One cheese ball hits the Dreamship, and a second sweeps Reader Rabbit and Sam overboard. Luckily, they collide with a hovercraft and land safely on Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island, a small island made of cheese. Meanwhile, the Dreamship crash-lands on nearby Mt. Cheesemore Island.
The hovercraft is piloted by Professor Heathormen, a famous scientist who studies insects. Reader Rabbit and Sam want to borrow the hovercraft to travel to Mt. Cheesemore Island and find the Dreamship. But the collision badly damaged the hovercraft, so the professor must fix it before it can go anywhere. Unfortunately, the barrels that hold his repair materials—macaroni fruit, blue cheese bricks, and French bread loaves—are completely empty.
Can you help Reader Rabbit and Sam explore Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island in search of repair materials for the hovercraft? Be sure to collect enough items to fill up each of Professor Heathormen’s barrels. Then help the professor with his insect work so that he’ll have time to fix the hovercraft. Soon you’ll be on your way to Mt. Cheesemore Island to look for the Dreamship!
Be careful! Once you find the Dreamship, you’ll need to sneak by the hungry pirates who are guarding it. And even after you finally board the Dreamship, you’ll face one last surprise before you can head home to Wordville!

Feel the adrenaline rush of landing trophy sized largemouth  bass and the thrill of fighting huge carp and monster pike as perfectly  combined realistic game physics and accurate fish AI create an  authentic experience that will have you hooked from the start. Whether  you’re a beginner or an experienced angler there’s something for you to  enjoy in Fishing Sim World.,
Your  angling skills will be tested to the limit by the seven different  destinations that await you in Fishing Sim World. Each present their own  challenges and vary from huge North American Lakes to picturesque  venues in Europe. Highlights include the sun drenched Lake Johnson in  Florida and the glacial Lake Boulder in upstate New York, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. Of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and Fishing Sim World features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, Bass Cat Boats. Drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your Sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

Other  highlights include France’s famous Gigantica Main Lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘Fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. That’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the UK’s Grand Union Canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
Fishing Sim World launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique AI and  behavioural systems. To help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. Target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from Duckett Fishing and  Fitzgerald Fishing. Equip your reels with line from Fitzgerald or  Sunline and select the correct lures or baits from Nichols Lures,  Missile Baits and Bill Lewis (Rat-L-Trap). Target carp with equipment  from leading names including Korda, RidgeMonkey, Mainline Baits and  Delkim.
Not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. You will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
Fishing Sim World reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. Featuring the launch of ‘The Dovetail  Fishing League’ (DFL) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘Angler  of the Month.’ The DFL consists of multiple events split across four  different series. Each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  Global Season Leaderboard. Players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for PC), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on Steam and voice  chat for console.
So  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the USA, spinning for a monster  pike in England, or sat by the side of a peaceful French carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
Fishing  Sim World will be available to buy on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam  (PC) from 18th September. In the meantime, explore the Fishing Sim  World hub on Dovetail Live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

As the main character and his friend Miki pass a leisurely afternoon, Miki suddenly collapses from an unkown illness. When the girl shows no sign of waking, the main character grows distraught over not being a better friend and not having the means to save her.
Suddenly, a strange voice offers him a second chance: ""Beyond the door you can change your destiny!"" He soon leaves the real world and journeys to the world of Vision, where, as a novice ""Traveler"", he will surmount myriad ordeals in hopes of ultimately meeting with the Goddess of Destiny to have a single wish granted.

This heritage  has been celebrated in PES 2016’s new tagline ‘Love The Past, Play The Future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core PES values in last  year’s PES 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
PES 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘Best  Sports Game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘The Beautiful Game’. The series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present PES 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘The Pitch is Ours’ mantra. From  further integration of the industry leading Fox Engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of Master League, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
Fresh Gameplay – Exciting advancements reaffirming the PES series as having the No.1 gameplay.

Advanced Collision System – The physicality of the modern game has been realised in PES 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
Aerial Strength – With the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 Control – In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
Perfect Defence – Performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
Intelligent Player AI – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
Goal Keeper ID – In a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and  Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
Celebration Control – New for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

Fundamental Changes – New significant improvements across key modes and features.

New Master League – The famous and hugely popular  Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
New Visuals – Incorporating the many advancements  of the Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
Dynamic Weather – For the first time in the PES  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes  including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
Human Motion – Seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
New Ball Physics – The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

Quality Improvements – Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myClub – Since the launch of the mode in PES  2015, myClub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for PES 2016.  The enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. Use GP acquired through matches or myClub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. Choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. Build Your  Team, Create Your legacy!
Dynamic Wide Camera Angle – The new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to Intelligent Player AI. Depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
Commentary – New commentators have been  introduced for both UK and Germany, with Peter Drury and Marco Hagemann  joining the PES team. An abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for Master League, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
PS4 Image Importing – Edit mode is synonymous  with the PES series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. PS4 (and PS3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

PES 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the UEFA Champions League club competition, which was announced  recently. This new 3 year partnership allows KONAMI to feature both the  UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the UEFA Super Cup  featured within the iconic Master League mode.

While behind enemy lines, you discover they have done much more than develop a new weapon. The Nazis are harnessing the power of a dark parallel dimension called The Veil; in order to create a weapon of war-ending magnitude.
Move between the Nazi's dark reality and yours as you command an enormous arsenal of Resistance and Axis Weapons. You can also turn to the Black Market for weapon upgrades, or unleash the Nazis own dark powers and perverted science against them with supernatural weapons and Veil-enhanced firepower.

The scenario is modern warfare: It is 1985, in the midst of the Cold War, and Gorbachev has been elected to power bringing with him policies of glasnost and perestroika. However, resistance Soviet groups are opposed to the new wave and are refusing to serve the new regime in Moscow. One group has taken control of an island community, and is using it as an armed stronghold for the old order. Operation Flashpoint: Elite opens with the player joining the neighbouring US force against the Soviets. Additionally, a prequel campaign titled Resistance, set years before Operation Flashpoint's Cold War Crisis, has been added. Resistance creates an additional 100km2 island and casts the player as Victor Troska, an experienced ex-Special Forces soldier forced to lead the ramshackle Resistance effort against the Soviets before the invasion of the Malden Islands.

Solar Boy Django and Master Otenko return to their hometown San Miguel, after cleansing Istrakan - ‘City of Death - of its vampires (a.k.a. the Immortals). Instead of the heroes’ welcome they expect Django and Master Otenko find the entire population of San Miguel has become zombies!
Once more the power of real sunlight is used to purify the Immortals. In addition to Django’s trademark Solar Gun, a new Pile Driver weapon helps him dispose of the bad guys. Sunlight is captured via the Game Pak’s inbuilt light sensor, which also works alongside the Game Boy Advance internal clock to mirror the time of day. During daylight hours it’s safe to hunt down the Immortals because they are weak. However you’d better beware at night, because vampires become active and are much stronger.
It’s spooky business, and it can get tough, so if you’re scared to go it alone you can link up with friends using the Game Boy Advance Link Cable. Between 2-4 players may face the Immortals this way.

combat and trained for action. Three years ago you assaulted   
a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon   
civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Pearl   
Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the   
Union Aerospace Corporation. 
The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive   
waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and   
Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day   
consisted of suckin' dust and watchin' restricted flicks in   
the rec room. 
For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest   
supplier, has used the remote facilities on Phobos and   
Deimos to conduct various secret projects, including   
research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far they have   
been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos,   
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out   
the other. Recently however, the Gateways have grown   
dangerously unstable. Military ""volunteers"" entering them   
have either disappeared or been stricken with a strange form   
of insanity--babbling vulgarities, bludgeoning anything that   
breathes, and finally suffering an untimely death of full-  
body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to   
the folks became a full-time job. Latest military reports   
state that the research is suffering a small set-back, but   
everything is under control. 
A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from   
Phobos. ""We require immediate military support. Something   
fraggin' evil is coming out of the Gateways! Computer   
systems have gone berserk!"" The rest was incoherent. Soon   
afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky. Since then,   
attempts to establish contact with either moon have been   
unsuccessful. 
You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty   
million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were   
ordered to secure the perimeter of the base while the rest   
of the team went inside. For several hours, your radio   
picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling   
orders, screams, bones cracking, then finally, silence.   
Seems your buddies are dead. "

Guards rushed after him, only to see him transform into a ferocious creature: a dragon. Tyrhung flew off toward the Forest of Mist, scattering the fog with his powerful wings.

You'll need to think on your feet, however, in order to emerge victorious from the multiple mission types comprising of so many diverse goals. The whole experience is geared towards a cinematic presentation, of the standard associated with Touchstone Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer. The realism, and painstaking attention to detail of King Arthur the movie is mirrored in Krome Studios' game.

Familiar chess pieces are brought to life as richly detailed 3D models, with players seeing the spectacular results of their actions in their quest for domination of the board.

The traditional white and black armies have evolved into an army of light with their brave knights in shining armor, pitted against the wicked dark army of demons and beastly golems. Each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war. If a square is occupied by an enemy unit, they enter into a brutal clash that sees the foe removed from the board in bloody combat.

Another evolutionary element Battle vs. Chess brings to the arena is the addition of the optional Action Mode. If selected, instead of entering a scripted animation when attacking, players challenge their opponent in a beat-'em-up style encounter. Using a variety of weapons, fighting techniques and combos, players must best their opponent in a fast-paced flurry of blows and special moves –adding a whole new meaning to the phrase checkmate. "

Breaking with  traditional game conventions where necessary, the gameplay will be based  around story, emotional involvement and the player’s decisions and  interactions, rather than high-scores, combat and competition. Intuitive  gameplay and controls are also fundamental to the experience – ensuring  that the game is mature but accessible, and avoiding alienating players  with obscure stats and complex interfaces.In Heavy Rain you  don’t watch the story – you play it. The dynamic narrative unfolds  through the players actions - not cut scenes - and every action has a  consequence. The choices you make and the way you interact with other  characters have repercussions throughout the storyline. With  unprecedented responsibility over the fates of the game’s characters,  players will find Heavy Rain an emotional experience unlike any other.  It dares to tackle subject matter and themes rarely touched upon in  video games, making it a genuinely mature game for a new world of adult  gamers. "

His vision and creative mind were the driving force behind the very beginning of Hellboy so all of the same dark humour and action the comics were and still are famed for is here in abundance. The second is that thanks to assistance from the movie director Guillermo del Toro, at the helm for the movie sequel, clips and action sequences from that film will be present here too and the characters from the movie also voice their characters in the game to add to the realism. Science of Evil, as you would expect, is a brawling action title that really shows you the brutal strength Hellboy possesses. His powers can rip apart the scenery and levels and use them as weapons against the enemy and this is often a necessity as wave upon wave of attackers descend on Hellboy.Source - www.Konami.com "

Slip into a pair of overalls and try your hand at running a farm! From tending to the fields where your cows graze to gathering eggs for sale at the town market, Farm Frenzy is as stimulating as the real thing, only you won't have to experience the nasty smells! You will, however, be required to invest the money you earn in new equipment. Building a cheese dairy, for example, allows you to process your milk on the spot and make even more cash!
To beat a level in Farm Frenzy, you must complete a specific task, such as producing a certain number of eggs. Each new level is more challenging than the last, so you must increase the capacity of your warehouse and improve the performance of your production facilities. You can even buy a larger truck capable of delivering more goods to market! All of this makes dealing with the occasional bear easier. Featuring compelling and enjoyable gameplay, Farm Frenzy lets you give Old MacDonald a run for the money!

Slayers! Go forth and eradicate the Oni menace! Experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
Trapped in an endless battle against the deadly Oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""Slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. This game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger Oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
Open World
From the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. The lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the Otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the Oni. The Otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. Experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. You will come across many colorful characters and deadly Oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
Evolved Attacks
The ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the Oni's body parts. The giant Demon Hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive Oni into the ground with ease. You can also extinguish the life force within an Oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
All-new Story
You assume the role of one of the Slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. During the fierce battle known as the Awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to Mahoroba Village. Waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the Professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the Oni.

Could the wealthy and mysterious Max Winters be involved? New York City needs the Turtles now more than ever but they face their most trying time both as heroes and as brothers. With the fate of the City and their family at stake, it’s up to Leonardo with Zen Master Splinter to restore unity and ninja discipline to the Turtles. Join the Ninja Turtles team and experience unique acrobatic navigation, collaborative combat and powerful fighting moves. Engage in over-the-top Ninja action to reunite the Turtles and save New York City.
Features

Embody All Four Famous Turtles Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are playable, each with unique acrobatic moves, weapons and combat skills, such as Michelangelo’s fast nunchuk face slap and Raphael’s powerful Sai throw.
Extends the TMNT Movie Experience The video game uses the same dark and dangerous environments and same themes in the new TMNT movie. Will the Turtles be able to unite against the odds or will sibling rivalries create an unstoppable rift between the brothers? Only the player’s abilities can determine the outcome for the family.
Intense Ninja Fighting By harnessing the power of Ninjitsu, the four Turtles have become masters of combat. Leonardo shows a calm discipline when he faces his foes, attacking carefully and masterfully. Donatello’s bow staff can be used to reach distant enemies and as a pivot for him to swing himself around the arena. Michelangelo is a fast, flamboyant, energetic fighter, good for quick slashes with nearby enemies but for powerful direct attacks nothing beats the intensity of Raphael’s powerful Sai punches.
Unique Acrobatic Navigation The Turtles jump from rooftop to rooftop, scale tall buildings, dive into sewers and race through every corner of the city to confront their enemies. Using the Jade Engine (Prince of Persia franchise), Ubisoft’s acclaimed Montreal development team brings a unique fast-paced navigation element to the Turtles gameplay.
Powerful Tag Team Moves Together the Turtles can team up to reach locations unattainable alone, or use their unique individual abilities to find alternate routes and secret areas of New York City. By pairing up in combat, the Turtles can leverage their combined powers to create a multitude of devastating attacks to cripple the enemy.
Diverse Enemies and Bosses Characters from the movie and the original comic book series creep out of the shadows to face the Turtles. From the Purple Dragon Street Gang to the infamous Foot Clan, a new group of enemies lurks in the sewers. Find out what their plan is and how the Turtles can stop them.
