However, the Dark Demon King, seeking their power, stole the orbs and captured the wise men. Demons began to flood the Kingdom, whose end was thought to be near.
It was at that time that a young warrior appeared from seemingly nowhere, saved the wise men and returned the orbs to their rightful place. Following a great battle, the warrior and the wise men combined the orbs into one and sealed the Demon King away.
The Kingdom prospered for some time after that. However, as time passed, the story of the young warrior became a legend and visitors stopped coming to the Kingdom. It was then that the King made the decision: ""From now on, it will be the 3D era."" Under orders from the King, the Kingdom was changed from 2D to 3D, and began progressing towards a restoration of past grandeur. Just as people began to get used to their new life however, something happened.
You play as a descendant of the hero who saved the Kingdom and are now tasked with saving the world, as the orbs have gone missing...

The game was a hit in the arcade and spawned the updated NBA Jam Tournament Edition and then NBA Hangtime and NBA Maximum Hangtime. On the home front, Acclaim was responsible for bringing Midway's arcade hits to consoles and, given NBA Jam was the top-grossing arcade game ever to that point in time, quickly produced home versions for the SNES and Sega Genesis, which both sold very well, as well as for myriad other systems, and then released NBA Jam Tournament Edition to line their pockets even further.By this point in time, Midway, seeing they were getting the short end of the stick with Acclaim making tons of money off their popular games (besides NBA Jam, Acclaim also made home versions of the popular Mortal Kombat series) terminated their agreement with Acclaim with the intent of publishing future home versions of their arcade games.  However, Acclaim responded with an end run around Midway, securing the rights to the NBA Jam name directly from the NBA.  This resulted in the series being bastardized in games like NBA Jam Extreme, which was made solely by Acclaim.Midway, however, sucked it up, changed the name to NBA Hangtime, and continued.  They ported the arcade version to SNES, Genesis, Playstation, N64 and other machines.GameplayNBA Hangtime at its heart is no-holds-barred, few rules followed arcade basketball 2-on-2 crazyness.  It can be played by up to 4 players, with each player controlling one real-life NBA player with varying statistics.  If less than 4 players are available, the computer takes control of the rest of the players.The controls consist of three buttons and a joystick.  The stick is used for moving.  The buttons are shoot/jump, pass/steal and turbo.  The shoot button lets you shoot (duh), jump up for rebounds, and jump to block opposing shots when on defense.  The pass button lets you pass (duh) and steal when on defense.  Turbo is used by itself to let you run faster, or in combination with the other buttons to either jump higher/quicker or to shove opposing players, often causing them to lose the ball.You can also tap turbo twice to do a spin move, making you very difficult to shove during the move.  There are other moves like alley-oops, hook shots, fadeaways, lean-in shots, throwing elbows, double dunks, super dunks and more that you can perform with well-timed button presses.Other features include a player-creation mode (including choosing your own nickname on the court), record-keeping of your characters and the ability for them to improve stats, a trivia quiz at the end of the game, tons of secret codes for special characters/play modes, and a leaderboard.  Each NBA team has five players that you can team up in any way except two of the same.   "

Final Fantasy X
The world lies on the brink of destruction. Only a select few may be able to save it. 
In ages past, the world of Spira experienced a golden  age of perfection, brought about by an advanced civilization through the  use of wondrous machinery called machina..
However, around one thousand years before the present day, a  colossal menace known only as ""Sin"" appeared and sundered all before it.  Though a line of summoners have since brought Sin low many times, 						it inevitably returns in an unending cycle of destruction. In the  face of this ever-pervasive threat, the people of Spira flocked to the  teachings of Yevon, which tell that Sin is a punishment to 						those who relied overly on machina.
Tidus is a young Blitzball star that mysteriously finds himself  in Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin one  thousand years in the past. Believing Sin to be the key to returning  home, Tidus joins a young summoner named Yuna on her pilgrimage to  destroy Sin and bring about the Calm.
Final Fantasy X-2
Last time she saved the world. This time its personal!
Two years have passed since Sin was destroyed. Since  her victory and becoming a high summoner, Yuna has lived on her  childhood home of Besaid Island. Then one day, Rikku comes to Besaid and  shows Yuna a sphere. 						The recording is of him. Or is it?
Yuna can't tell whether it's him or just someone who looks like  him. If it is him, Yuna might be able to see him one more time. No  matter what the truth may be, the answers she finds may change things  forever.

The gameplay involved much hack and slash action elements with some RPG in the form of item use and spellcasting. The maps are essentially circular whereby you travel and you can end up at the same point by going in a full circle if you keep going to the left or right. The experience and health system is very interesting because it involves planting food and consuming it instead of your simple acquiring health items and such.Odin Sphere is set in Erion, a world of several large and powerful nations that hold an uneasy peace and keep each other in constant check. One day the most powerful country, Valentine, is mysteriously obliterated, sparking a war between two of the other nations, Ringford and Ragnaval. They go to war to fill the power vacuum, but what they do not realize is that their turmoil is part of a long-lost prophecy that could lead to the end of the world.

As you awaken, held captive in a nightmare prison of bones and with no memory of who you are and how you came to be there, all hope seems lost. Held prisoner by the evil sorcerer Magusar, you are little more than livestock – a human offering, kept alive only to be sacrificed to the dark arts that your captor practises. Just as all chances of escape seem to have been crushed – along with your fellow prisoners at the hands of Magusar – a potential saviour appears...
Librom, an enchanted talking book, begins calling to you from beneath a gruesome pile of bones, beckoning you closer to open his pages and begin reading the journal contained within. As you read, you are transported from your prison into a shadowy realm where you meet a young – and strangely familiar – sorcerer. Guided by Librom, you begin to relive the dark tale of the young mage’s training titled “The Sorcerer’s Ordeal” and learn the secrets of forgotten magic just as he did. To gain new spells and abilities, you must face a series of gruesome creatures that will put your skills to the test – from grotesque Goblins to huge, terrifying mythical creatures like the Harpy, Cerberus and the brutal Minotaur.
But with great power comes great sacrifice. To master the magic in Librom’s pages and become powerful enough to face Magusar and win your freedom, you must decide what you’re willing to sacrifice; your allies, your body… or your humanity.

THE AUTHORITY IN WWE VIDEO GAMES RETURNS WITH WWE 2K16!
The newest addition to the flagship WWE franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new WWE Superstars, Divas and Legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
Features 
•Largest Roster Ever: Offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin alongside Seth Rollins, Daniel Bryan, Dean Ambrose, Bad News Barrett, Paige and Finn Bálor, WWE 2K16 includes the largest roster in WWE games history
-The roster contains an unprecedented combination of current WWE Superstars and Divas, emerging NXT talent, WWE Hall of Famers and WWE alumni from multiple eras
•Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator: Fans who pre-order WWE 2K16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator:
-T-800 from The Terminator and T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
•2K Showcase: The franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in WWE 2K16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in WWE history. Along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•MyCareer: The franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from NXT to WWE to earn a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame. In addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•Creation Suite: Building on last year’s foundation, WWE 2K16’s Creation Suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including Create a Diva, Create a Championship, Create an Arena, and Create a Show. Key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including Create a Superstar, Create an Entrance, Superstar Studio and Community Creations.
•WWE Universe: WWE 2K16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. In addition, for the first time, Superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•Online: Completely overhauled based on fan feedback, WWE 2K16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the WWE Games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•Soundtrack: Players can customize their in-game music through the addition of Superstar entrance music to the WWE 2K16 Jukebox. Additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•Gameplay Improvements: WWE 2K16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest WWE gameplay experience to date:
-Improved Controls: The controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. This change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. WWE 2K16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. Opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-New Reversal System: The reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  Each Superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces Major and Minor reversals for select moves. Minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. Major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. Successful Major Reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-New Pin System: The new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. If the opponent kicks out, a Superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. Dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. There is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. Rope Breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. In line with WWE live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-Chain Wrestling: New positions and attributes allow players to distinguish Superstars from one other. There can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-Working Holds: Working holds are new for WWE 2K16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. Just like on WWE programming, Working Holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-Improved AI: WWE 2K16 sees big improvements to the AI for Superstars, referees and managers. For example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. In addition, significant changes are included for match-specific AI, including Tag Team matches.
-More Match Types: Many match types of been added for WWE 2K16, including Ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-Dynamic Entrances: With the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their Superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. Why wait for the bell? In WWE 2K16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•Additional Improvements: WWE 2K16 also includes an improved Submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•Overall Enhancements: WWE 2K16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-New Commentary Team: For the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with John “Bradshaw” Layfield, new to WWE 2K16 joining returning commentators Michael Cole and Jerry “The King” Lawler. Thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-Visual Upgrades: This year’s title features several thousand new animations. WWE Superstar and Diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. Improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-Broadcast Presentation: Gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. Significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

This epic journey propels Death  across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War,  the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in  Darksiders. Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the  series is primarily a hack ‘n slash adventure. The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.

Join the Corleone family and earn respect through loyalty and fear as you rise through the ranks to become Don in a living 1945-1955 New York. The Godfather™ The Game puts you at the center of the action in one of history's most revered cinematic masterpieces, letting you create yourself in the game and then choose your path as you rise from lowly outsider to envied and feared Don.
The Godfather The Game offers you countless choices for solving the family's problems with brutal violence, skillful diplomacy, or a cunning mixture of both. From mob hits and bank heists to drive-bys and extortion, step deep inside the world of The Godfather where intimidation and negotiation are your tickets to the top.
 




Respect and consequences: Players use their powers of loyalty and fear to earn respect throughout New York City. Decisions made by the player in the game have lasting consequences.
Persistent world of The Godfather: Your character interacts freely with other characters in the world. Depending on your needs and how you choose to play the game—by violent, intimidating, respectful, or negotiating means—the characters in the world will remember your interactions.
Blackhand controls and Pressure Point targeting: Being a gangster has never felt so good, and Blackhand puts the power of intimidation in the hands of the player. An analog control-based combat system gives players the use of both analog sticks and shoulder buttons to execute punches, kicks, and grabs, and even lets you strangle opponents. Pressure Point targeting helps lock on less lethal parts of an opponent's body so they're still around to provide vital information.
Create the new face of crime: Use the ""MobFace"" feature to create a new member of the Corleone family with your own tough, street-wise looks. Customize facial features and hair, suit up your created mobster in era clothing, and then lead him through the classic world of The Godfather.
Control New York: The Corleone family's control of New York is challenged by the four families from the fiction, including the Barzini, Cuneo, Stracci, and Tattaglia families.
Cinematic music: Academy Award-winning composer Bill Conti and Emmy Award-winning composer Ashley Irwin are collaborating to create more than 100 minutes of new music in addition to the classic soundtrack from the film.

Ten years after Inazuma Eleven 3,  newbie Arion Sherwind is putting on his Raimon High soccer kit. It’s  his first day, and he’s revved up to be joining the school’s famous  football club. But after a weird kid appears on the pitch, Arion works  out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called Fifth  Sector, the big bosses in charge of youth football. Time to lace up!
After you join the  school football club, you’ll need to recruit a team – and a ‘good’ one  won’t be enough. There are two ways to shape your squad: first, you  could thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to  join from an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards  from dealers. Think of them as brochures for new players, complete with  stats and sign-up requirements. As you play more and more, you can  potentially meet over a thousand players, but you only get 16 slots for  your team, and just 110 for the entire roster, so pick carefully!
When  the time comes to kick off, you’ll find two match types. The first one  is an 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise,  five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific  job, like scoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your  player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you  tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use  various statistics to plan your play – dodge or tackle.
Special  Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six,  super-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or  whenever certain players level up. Even better are the brand new  Fighting Spirits, which increase players’ statistics and allow for ever  more powerful Special Moves to help you get the edge over the opposing  team.
When you’re not on the pitch, you can explore the local  area, check things out, and talk to people to get the lowdown on school  life. Later on, you’ll be able to go to visit Inazuma town and stop off  at places like the Shopping Area or the Royal Academy. It all looks  gorgeous in full 3D, too!
Saving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth  Sector is only part of the package, as there’s a stack of other  challenges to tackle. Test your skills against up to three friends in  Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players during Story  Mode. You can get new characters and items via SpotPass, or use  StreetPass to receive other players' team data and play matches against  them.

Sniper Elite 4 is the next game in the award-winning, chart-topping shooter series.
Sniper  Elite 4 combines genre-defining ballistics, breathless emergent  stealth, and gripping third person action across the largest and most  diverse environments ever seen in a Sniper Elite game.
Welcome to Italy, 1943
Set  in the aftermath of its award-winning predecessor, Sniper Elite 4  continues the series’ World War Two heritage by transporting players  across the beautiful Italian peninsula, from sun-drenched Mediterranean  coastal towns, to colossal Nazi mega structures, daunting forests and  giddying mountain monasteries inspired by Monte Cassino.
Covert  agent and elite marksman Karl Fairburne must fight alongside the brave  men and women of the Italian Resistance to help free their country from  the yoke of Fascism, and defeat a terrifying new threat with the  potential to halt the Allied fightback in Europe before it’s even begun.
If his mission fails, there will be no Operation Overlord, no D-Day landings, and no Victory in Europe.

Chart topping songs from all around the world headline the track list in “Lips: Number One Hits”. This electrifying collection of irresistible dance-floor fillers includes classics from MC Hammer’s “U Can’t Touch This” to Timbaland’s “Apologize” featuring OneRepublic.
“Lips: Number One Hits” is available with the amazing Xbox 360 wireless motion sensitive microphone, which lets everyone hear your voice loud and clear as you launch into Coldplay’s “Viva La Vida” and traces your every move as you groove to Rihanna’s “Disturbia”. Strike the right pose or shake it like you mean it and you’ll trigger Star Stream Power to achieve incredible high scores. Motion sensitivity also means that you can use the mic for percussion accompaniment – not everybody needs to sing, but up to four people can help with the performance. The Xbox 360 wireless microphone is compatible with third-party music titles arriving in autumn.
In addition to enjoying all the great music, your superstar status can be further celebrated by integrating your Xbox LIVE avatar. This time round you’ll find your cool alter-ego appearing on the in-game menus. How great is that!
Don’t forget that new songs are being regularly added to Xbox LIVE Marketplace, and are accessible via the in-game Lips Music Store. The range is broader than ever, so everyone of your friends and family can take ‘their song’ and make it soar.
Both the original “Lips” and “Lips: Number One Hits” are the work of iNiS Corp, the celebrated Japanese creative team led by the very funky Keiichi Yano. These guys have been keeping videogames groovy for over a decade, and Lips: Number One Hits already feels like a celebration of all that’s gone before and much more.
Lips: Number One Hits is available for Xbox 360 from October 2009.

Featuring 50 Ferraris painstakingly modelled right down to the smallest detail, gamers are able to drive across every Ferrari Challenge series track with supreme handling, realistic AI and the most comprehensive custom vinyl editor ever offered in a racing title.  Features

Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli is the only video game to feature every track from the world renowned 430 series Ferrari Challenge. Every track has been recreated in painstaking detail, offering a racing experience closer to real life than ever before.
Recreating the experience of driving a Ferrari isn’t just about visual flair, but about how the car feels and sounds. System 3 has modelled each car in exquisite detail with engine and environmental audio recorded both internally and externally.
Once the race is over, watch television quality replays of the race from beginning to end. From behind the action, inside the wheel arch or overhead views, there is no competition for Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli’s replay system.
Driving the average car is nothing compared to the thrill and excitement of stepping behind the wheel of a Ferrari. Utilising some of the best development talent in the videogames and motorsport industries, System 3 has crafted a game that demands respect, and rewards it in return. With some of the most advanced handling physics achieved on each format, nothing will feel like a Ferrari before or after you sit behind the wheel in Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli.

The object of the game was quite simply.  At the top of the screen, there was a cobra who would shoot at the shield that protected the bootcamp.  The player's goal was to use two lazers (on opposite sides of the screen) to shoot the snake multiple times, killing it prior to the cobra destroying the shield, and thus leaving the camp unprotected.

Players can ride like 10-time World Vert Champion Mat Hoffman or as one of seven top pros and perform hundreds of freestyle tricks in a variety of realistic vert, street, and dirt courses.   They gave the world Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. You should thank your lucky stars each and every day for Activision. And now they're doing it again, so get down on your knees and wet your pucker for some toe kisses. Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX rides it like nobody's business, combining sick tricks out of this sprocket jockey's catalog with gnarly graphics running on the same killer engine as THPS. The difference? Bikes go where skateboards flake out, and this game is specially designed to be a whole new experience, with street, vert, and dirt courses busted out of real locales and pro concept tracks.   Eight real professional riders--Mike Escamilla, Dennis McCoy, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Cory Nastazio, and of course Mat himself--are on the lip to drop in for some hardcore action, each packing their own set of tricks to throw on the ramps, jumps, curbs, and funboxes on the courses. As with any good stunt riding, half the fun comes in showing up the other guys, and this game delivers with head-to-head multiplayer modes. And when the dirt seems all ground out and you find yourself comboing into rails with your eyes closed from mastery of the game, throw yourself for a loop with the game's BMX Course Editor. You can play those other games with four wheels on the ride...if you really think you need training wheels. Otherwise, put yourself on two tires and show what BMX is all about.

From the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid  HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid  titles from   the past in true HD for the first time ever. Featuring three complete  games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake  Eater   and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and  new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and  storytelling of the   MGS franchise.
The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo  Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth  action game   genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million  copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite   special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through  enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of  battle.   Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will  find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the  series'   popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat,  and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.
The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends  seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive  research and   incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.
These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of  entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video  games, and one   of the leading products of the Japanese content business.



METAL GEAR SOLID 2

After the Shadow Moses incident, technological data on the  nuclear-armed walking tank Metal Gear leaks onto the black market. Solid  Snake and his   allies form the anti-Metal Gear NGO ""Philanthropy"" and set out in  pursuit of a tanker carrying a new Metal Gear prototype. But Snake falls  into a   trap set by former FOXHOUND member Ocelot, and is believed lost along  with the tanker at the bottom of the Hudson River. Two years later, the  Big Shell, an oil   spill cleanup facility constructed on the bay, is taken over by  terrorists led by a man claiming to be the long-lost Solid Snake. The  government   sends Raiden, a new recruit in the new FOXHOUND, to infiltrate the Big  Shell and rescue the US President, who is held hostage inside... The  underlying theme of this         second entry in the series is ""memes,"" or cultural genes.


METAL GEAR SOLID 3

The story shifts back in time to 1964, the height of the Cold  War. Naked Snake-the man who would later become the legendary mercenary  known as Big         Boss-heads into Soviet territory to help the scientist Sokolov  defect to the West. But the mission ends in failure due to the betrayal  of Snake's         mentor and mission advisor The Boss, a female soldier known as  ""the Mother of Special Forces."" The Boss defects to the Soviet Union,  taking a miniature         nuclear warhead with her as a gift, which her new hosts promptly  launch at a Russian research facility. Naked Snake heads once more into  the Soviet         Union on a mission to kill The Boss... The third MGS game tells  the story of men and women who struggle to remain loyal even while their  fates are at         the mercy of the ever changing political ""scene.""


METAL GEAR SOLID: PEACE WALKER

Stories tell of a legendary solider who once waged war against  the world. His name was Naked Snake, a.k.a. Big Boss, and the truth  behind this         legend will finally be told. The era is the 1970's . Big Boss  had stationed his soldiers in Colombia, South America, where he was         approached by visitors from Costa Rica, a ""nation without a  military."" In the shadow of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as Latin America  became a key         to maintaining the power balance between East and West, Costa  Rica had miraculously managed to maintain its peace and neutrality.  However, in         various regions of the country, a mysterious armed force seemed  to be engaging in suspicious activities. Now, to preserve peace in this  nation         without a military, the soldiers move into action. In time, they  would be known as the founders of ""Outer Heaven.""

If you're a music lover then the  unique new game Jam with the Band  will help transform your Nintendo DS  into a fun, portable music maker  allowing you to get creative with  your friends.

Following on from a range of acclaimed music games like Rhythm   Paradise and Wii Music, Jam with the Band allows you to get creative and   program your own tracks in the game’s song editor using up to eight   different parts on each track from a collection of more than 50   instruments, or create melodies by simply humming into the Nintendo DS   in-built microphone.

There is a captivating difficulty mode which takes you from utilising   one or four buttons whilst jamming to eight and ten, or play with the   stylus and Touch Screen in your music-making challenges. And why keep  it  to yourself? With one copy of the game up to eight people can each  take  a part and jam together!
You can also connect your Nintendo DS or Nintendo DSi to your Wii   console and send the sounds from your Nintendo DS to the speakers of   your TV sound system.  A free Jam with the Band Live channel for Wii can   be downloaded, meaning you and up to seven friends can enjoy the whole   sound of the band from one set of speakers!

Players need both puzzle-solving skills and creativity to earn a picture reward. Creating puzzles is a snap. Players design their puzzles by hand or draw any picture they like and convert it automatically into a Picross puzzle.Trade puzzles with friends using local wireless or Nintendo® Wi-Fi Connection or download free bonus puzzle packs.Play with up to five friends in Picross-themed minigames over local wireless, or race to complete puzzles against other gamers on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.How to progress through the game: Each puzzle has a sequence of numbers written in the margins of each column and each row. Those numbers show how many squares within that column or row need to be filled in. Players must deduce where each filled square is based on the numbers in the puzzle. Incorrect guesses earn the player a time penalty. If players solve the puzzle in under one hour, they earn a reward picture, an animated illustration of the thing represented in the puzzle. Puzzles range in size from simple 5x5 squares to much more challenging 15x15 squares—and larger. Players can create and swap puzzles with one another.My Picross: With My Picross, players can create their own puzzles, complete with reward pictures, and transfer them to friends using either local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Because making a good Picross puzzle can be challenging, Picross DS automates the process and helps correct errors in homemade puzzles. Additionally, Picross DS can automatically generate puzzles from any drawing made in this mode.Daily Picross: Daily Picross features a series of quick-play puzzle sets that players can return to day after day to test their skill over time. The longer players have the game, the more activities open up. Each activity features a special challenge that builds Picross skills. Daily Picross modes include Nonstop Time Attack (players solve a series of simple puzzles as quickly as possible), No X Marks (players cannot make notes on the game screen), Error Search (in which players must find the incorrect squares in a puzzle) and more. These challenges open up over time.Local Wireless: Host a game with up to four friends (a total of five people), and test their Picross skills with Multi-Picross word and picture challenges. In word challenges, the host writes out a word that gets divided into a series of Picross puzzles (one for each letter), and players must solve the individual letters until they can guess what the word is. In picture challenges, the host draws a picture that gets converted instantly into a Picross puzzle. As players solve the puzzle, they’ll also uncover the host’s original drawing—the player who correctly identifies that drawing wins. Multiplayer matches can be played using only one game card, so anyone with a DS can join in. And, of course, players can exchange puzzles they’ve created with one another, opening up a new world of challenges and, if their friends are curious about Picross, they can send a downloadable demo puzzle.Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: By logging onto Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, players can compete with one another in puzzle-solving races or download new puzzle packs from the Picross community. The puzzle-solving races pit two players against one another to compete to finish two puzzles. Players also can upload their own, homemade puzzles to a special Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection storage area where people on their Friend Roster can download their puzzles. (Note: puzzles cannot be shared with people not on a player’s Friend Roster.) "

Features:

Money Talks, Silence Pays – This time you not only get paid for your jobs but you get to make a decision on what you do with your hard earned cash. Do you spend money on getting the latest weapon upgrade or do you bribe the police to clean up the last job so none knows you did it?


Competition Heats Up – Agent 47 is up against a rival agency of deadly assassins, who are not only competing to take out high-priced targets, but may even be targeting Agent 47 himself.


New U.S. Locations – yes that’s right folks 47 is heading for the US and as part of his tour de force he will be making his presence felt in such iconic American cities, such as the gambling world of Las Vegas, the bright lights of Los Angeles, and mysteries of New Orleans.


Prepare to Make a Killing – New to the world of getting paid for killing? Then don’t worry, just like Leon in the Professional, we will not only give you a hand in how to play, but have introduced a new game play mode to make sure the Rookies amongst us can get in and play the game as we want.


Accidents Happen – What better way to make sure that latest kill doesn’t come back to haunt you than to make your hits look like an accident? The all new accident system allows you even more freedom in your choice of how take a target out – drop a priceless chandelier, use a remote bomb, create a nasty slip into a turning paddle wheel – all designed to terminate your targets without creating alarm or suspicion.


All-new Glacier Game Engine – Since his last outing 47 has found himself in an all new gaming engine, now with a number of new moves and a revamped NPC and AI system the world of being an assassin has never been more realistic.


Sick of getting caught? – 47 now has the ability to hide bodies in boxes and enclosed spaces.

Now, after ten years,  she has finally secured her release--yet she still bears the heavy  psychological burden of that tragic event.   In Alice: Madness  Returns, Alice is released from the asylum to a London psychiatrist’s  care. As nightmarish hallucinations continue to haunt her and invade her  reality, she seeks to understand her torment in order to recover  herself. Her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear and  neuroses prompted by her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Her  relocation to London seems only to add to their number and intensity.   Perhaps  she’ll do better in Wonderland. She always has. She travels there,  seeking what the “real” world can’t provide: security, knowledge, and  the truth about the past. But in her absence, Wonderland too has  suffered. Something has gone horribly wrong, and now a great evil is  descending upon what once was her beautiful refuge.    Can Alice save Wonderland—and herself—from the madness that consumes them both?

Steel Diver is a new action-packed submarine combat game  from Nintendo that immerses players in the 3D action with unique game  controls and lush 3D environments. The player can choose from three  different submarines, each with touch-screen control panels that players  will have to master to guide them through treacherous undersea caverns  while engaging enemy submarines, dodging depth charges and battling  massive sea creatures. Steel Diver also takes advantage of the built-in  gyroscope of the Nintendo 3DS system. The combination of 3D game play  and one-of-a-kind controls makes for an immersive combination that must  be experienced to be believed.
FEATURES:
Use touch-screen controls to guide submarines through lush, undersea 3D environments.
Branching paths, split-second decisions and attacks from enemy ships make for a thrilling undersea adventure.
Multiple ways to play Missions: Players manipulate control panels on the touch screen to  control the sub’s speed, depth and pitch, and to fire torpedoes as they  make their way toward the end of each level. If the sub takes damage and  starts taking on water, players can use the stylus on the touch screen  to stop the leak. There is also a time attack mode that challenges the  player to get through levels as quickly as possible.
Periscope  Strike: The gyroscope for the Nintendo 3DS system allows players to  control the periscope view by rotating their bodies. Players use the  touch screen to fire a well-placed torpedo and take enemies out.
Steel  Commander: In this two-player strategy mode, a local wireless  connection pits player against player. The game is a top-down,  turn-based “chess-like” game that puts players in command of a fleet of  ships and a sub. Once players locate a ship, they enter Periscope Mode  and blast it out of the water.
Immersive undersea graphics The  3D in Steel Diver makes players feel like they are peering into an  aquarium, with the action unfolding right before their eyes.

Featuring  the Mercenaries stages from Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5  re-mastered for the Nintendo 3DS system, it's a race against time as you  try to defeat as many of the infected enemies as possible before the  countdown reaches zero. The fast-paced, combat intensive action of Resident Evil: The  Mercenaries 3D is available both as a solo experience, or gamers across  the world can team up and enjoy two-player co-op either wirelessly or  online and work together to take out as many infected and Bio-Organic  Weapons (B.O.W.) as possible.  The action takes place over 30 missions  in classic areas from RE4 and RE5 including the Village and The Mines.  Gamers will have the opportunity to tackle the game's missions with 8  legendary Resident Evil characters from past and present: Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentine, Krauser, Hunk, Claire Redfield, Albert Wesker,  Rebecca Chambers and Barry Burton.  You will also face off against some  of the most terrifying enemies and B.O.W.s that have ever been seen in  the Resident Evil series, including the Executioner and Popo Karimu.  The mission ends if you complete the mission conditions that have been  set for that stage or once the timer has run out.  Don't worry though -  you can add more time to a mission by destroying the time bonus columns  or using physical attacks to take down enemies (rather than shooting  them!).  The faster you clear the missions, and the more melee attacks  you use, the more points you will earn.

We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.
In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents.
You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.

Wherever you went, you always enjoyed trips out to the country, where  you'd pet the animals, taste fresh-grown food, and dream of a slow,  steady life.
Now that you're old enough, and as your family's about to  move again, you've just announced to them that you're striking out on  your own, determined to become the farmer you've always wanted to be.  Your father has his doubts, to say the least, but he's willing to let  you try.
Your journey brings you to a unique spot in the  countryside, where three different towns with three very different  cultures converge as friends and neighbors. Westown, with its cows and  corrals, has everything the classic frontier settler needs. Right next  door is Tsuyukusa, which serves as the very model of a traditional Far  Eastern village. Rounding out the neighborhood is Lulukoko: a warm,  friendly paradise to rival any tropical island.
Situated at the crossroads of these diverse places, it's  up to you to learn the ropes, tend your own farm, care for your crops  and animals, navigate the complexities of different cultures, prove  yourself to your family, and just maybe raise one of your own while  you're at it.

You're in the Movies brings the cool factor to kitsch as you live out your dreams of becoming a scream queen, zombie, or kung fu fighter. Premiering exclusively on Xbox 360® this holiday season, it's the first and only game of its kind to transport players into a magical world of cinema mixed with the hilarious world of improvisation. Using the Xbox LIVE Vision camera, players' actions are captured and placed into short, riotous films that highlight the unique and often dubious acting talents of friends and family. Performances never end up on the cutting room floor and are never the same. With You're in the Movies, you're about to be a star—if only straight to DVD. Get ready for your close-up.




Starring in your very own B-movie: You're in the Movies gives players, who can be anything from an action hero to a silent film star, a choice of fun and kitschy scripts in different genres. B-list actors often can't be picky, but now you can feel free to pick a genre, pick a script, and get to work becoming the star you were always meant to be.
Casting call: Up to four people at a time can bask in the spotlight and play starring roles. But rest assured, even your greatest fans will have fun watching from the sidelines! A top-notch director guides actors through their roles with simple instructions and immediate feedback; in fact, the director even rates actors on their physical performance in mini-games. This exciting scoring system will also keep all you A-listers from getting too lazy.
Take the director's chair: Jump into Director Mode and cut a trailer for the movie you just made. Getting the distribution deal is great, but unless you have a great trailer, no one will see your movie. Lock yourself in the edit room and get to work.
The miracle of technology: The Xbox LIVE Vision camera captures player movements using a green screen type of technology. You're in the Movies allows players' best and most hilarious performances to be documented, saved, shared, and relived.

Players become familiar characters from the Nintendo and DRAGON QUEST universes in a board game that challenges them to play the real estate and stock markets wisely to win. Players race around the board trying to accumulate wealth and hit a target value while buying, selling and trading property with friends and family to see who can be the first to cash out. What appears at first to be a simple property-buying board game offers multiple levels of money-maximizing opportunity.  Players move around one of more than 15 boards, buying shops to build their portfolios and collecting symbols they can cash in at the bank to earn more gold to invest. It takes money to make money, so racing around the board may not be the best strategy.
• To capitalize on their monetary gains, players can make investments, play the stock market, purchase shops and collect shopping fees. Players with multiple shops adjacent to one another see them grow in value and their shops level up. Other players who land on those squares have to pay an increased shopping fee.
• Players can choose to play as a variety of Mushroom Kingdom characters, as DRAGON QUEST characters or even as their own Mii™ characters.
• More than 15 different game boards are available, providing endless replay value.
• The beginner setting helps newcomers learn the basics, while a more advanced mode introduces more challenges, deeper strategy options and the ability to play the stock market.
• The franchise has been a hit in Japan, and this marks its first appearance in North America.

I don’t want to shank it.” Earning the prestigious title of #1 Golfer of All Time can be a nerve racking process and it’s exactly what gamers will experience in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 as they fight off more than just pressure but also the man who’s trying to claim that title for his own, Tiger Woods.    In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06, gamers will attempt to settle the old debate of just who is the #1 Golfer of All Time. They’ll play golf legends such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan on their terms and in their specific eras (equipment, clothing and all). However, Tiger Woods is also there and is after the same goal. It’s your job to find him, stop him, and ultimately supplant him as the #1 golfer of every era. Duel with Tiger in multiple matches as he becomes your nemesis, chasing and even taunting you in every tournament.    Just as it is on the PGA TOUR®, the key to a good shot is execution and precision. In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 both analog sticks are used to give more control than ever over each shot. The left analog stick will continue to control the backswing and downswing, while the right analog stick, or “Shape stick”, controls ball trajectory and spin. Players are now challenged to focus on the impact point on the ball, while thinking more strategically before executing a shot. This also extends to putting where players will have to rely more on finesse and will need to move the analog stick only as far as needed to make the putt   The game of golf is as much psychological as it is physical and a key for gamers in 2006 will be maintaining confidence. With tension on every shot and mounting pressure to become the best, you can either keep your composure or lose it and become that embarrassing hack on the course. Based on good or bad shots or scores you make, a Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease based on the amount of confidence you possess.Dual Analog Swing and Putting   New advanced swing technique uses both analog sticks to “shape” shots. The left analog stick executes the swing and the right analog stick shapes the shot, controlling ball trajectory and spin. While putting, players will rely on “touch” and finesse as they swing the analog stick only as far as needed to make a putt. A new aiming mechanism also enables the user to line up and gauge putting speed.   Gamebreaker  Based on good or bad shots and scores you make, your Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease. When you hit certain thresholds you’ll earn the opportunity to trigger a Gamebreaker situation, giving you the ability to hit a longer and more accurate shot.   Wagering and Shot Calling  Call your shot before making it and reap the rewards. Players can elect to “call their shot” before making it, putting up a wager that they can pull it off.   Courses  Play a total of 15 courses (11 licensed and three fantasy courses) including the site of the 2005 British Open, St. Andrews Golf Links. Seven new licensed courses include TPC Sawgrass (Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.) Reflection Bay (Las Vegas, Nev.), Cog Hill Golf Club (Chicago, Ill.), Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club (Portland, Ore.), Sahalee Country Club (Seattle, Was.) and Doral Golf Resort (Miami, Fla).   PGA TOUR Players  Compete as or against 15 different PGA TOUR players including Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and new this year Chris DiMarco, Mike Weir, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald. Additionally, 12 new fantasy characters will challenge you on the links   EA SPORTS Online Competition  Play with up to four players across the country on the PlayStation 2 console or Xbox Live. Compete in Online Tournament events complete with money lists, full stat tracking, and league leaders.   Play a Career  In PGA TOUR Season mode for console versions, play along with the 52-week PGA TOUR calendar of events for up to 30 seasons. Obtain sponsorships from real golf equipment manufacturers throughout your career and drive to surpass Tiger Woods as #1 on the overall money list.   GameFace  Players will once again use the industry leading character creation technology GameFace to create their own golfer, outfit and build up their golfer’s attributes to attempt to become the #1 Golfer of All Time. New this year is the ability to choose your own voice for your character.   Reactive Tiger Proofing  The course will literally fight back. Courses will become more difficult as you score well, and will ease up if you play poorly.

There are 4 modes of play: Championship, Single Race, Arcade and Time Trial. In a race, if the players' cars run out of fuel or has their tires worn down, they are urged to take a pit stop where they engage in a brief minigame. Automobili Lamborghini featured nine cars that resembled actual supercars. These resembled cars such as the Porsche 959, Ferrari F50, Ferrari Testarossa, Dodge Viper, the McLaren F1, and the Bugatti EB110, that could be unlocked by winning championships. These were joined by the two default cars, which resembled the Lamborghini Countach and Lamborghini Diablo.

But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands.

THE AUTHORITY IN WWE VIDEO GAMES RETURNS WITH WWE 2K16!
The newest addition to the flagship WWE franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new WWE Superstars, Divas and Legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
Features 
•Largest Roster Ever: Offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin alongside Seth Rollins, Daniel Bryan, Dean Ambrose, Bad News Barrett, Paige and Finn Bálor, WWE 2K16 includes the largest roster in WWE games history
-The roster contains an unprecedented combination of current WWE Superstars and Divas, emerging NXT talent, WWE Hall of Famers and WWE alumni from multiple eras
•Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator: Fans who pre-order WWE 2K16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator:
-T-800 from The Terminator and T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
•2K Showcase: The franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in WWE 2K16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in WWE history. Along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•MyCareer: The franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from NXT to WWE to earn a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame. In addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•Creation Suite: Building on last year’s foundation, WWE 2K16’s Creation Suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including Create a Diva, Create a Championship, Create an Arena, and Create a Show. Key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including Create a Superstar, Create an Entrance, Superstar Studio and Community Creations.
•WWE Universe: WWE 2K16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. In addition, for the first time, Superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•Online: Completely overhauled based on fan feedback, WWE 2K16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the WWE Games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•Soundtrack: Players can customize their in-game music through the addition of Superstar entrance music to the WWE 2K16 Jukebox. Additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•Gameplay Improvements: WWE 2K16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest WWE gameplay experience to date:
-Improved Controls: The controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. This change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. WWE 2K16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. Opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-New Reversal System: The reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  Each Superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces Major and Minor reversals for select moves. Minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. Major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. Successful Major Reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-New Pin System: The new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. If the opponent kicks out, a Superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. Dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. There is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. Rope Breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. In line with WWE live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-Chain Wrestling: New positions and attributes allow players to distinguish Superstars from one other. There can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-Working Holds: Working holds are new for WWE 2K16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. Just like on WWE programming, Working Holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-Improved AI: WWE 2K16 sees big improvements to the AI for Superstars, referees and managers. For example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. In addition, significant changes are included for match-specific AI, including Tag Team matches.
-More Match Types: Many match types of been added for WWE 2K16, including Ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-Dynamic Entrances: With the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their Superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. Why wait for the bell? In WWE 2K16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•Additional Improvements: WWE 2K16 also includes an improved Submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•Overall Enhancements: WWE 2K16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-New Commentary Team: For the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with John “Bradshaw” Layfield, new to WWE 2K16 joining returning commentators Michael Cole and Jerry “The King” Lawler. Thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-Visual Upgrades: This year’s title features several thousand new animations. WWE Superstar and Diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. Improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-Broadcast Presentation: Gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. Significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

When the massive Terraformer  that supplies Mars with its Earth-like air and weather is destroyed,  the atmosphere turns to chaos, super-tornados and lightning storms  engulf the planet. To survive, the Colonists flee to the underground  mines and build a network of habitable caves.
Five years later, Darius Mason, grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya,  runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist  activity. Mining, scavenging, mercenary work--if the job is dangerous,  Darius is your man. Few sane people now venture to the ravaged surface,  aside from contractors like Darius and the smugglers who run goods  between the settlements.
When Darius is tricked  into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old Marauder temple, he releases  a long-dormant evil and unleashes Armageddon on Mars. As Colonist and  Marauder settlements are torn asunder, only Darius and the Red Faction  can save mankind. The battle will take them across the storm-blasted  planet--and below it, to the very heart of the unspeakable threat.

Based on the hit Anime series, Bleach: The Blade of Fate invites you to choose from 28 of your favourite Bleach characters and go to toe-to-toe with supernatural warriors as you infiltrate the Soul Society and save your friend Rukia.
You’ll have to master the art of attack and defence as you use quick-fire combos of varying strength to overcome the enemy and prove yourself a true warrior. As you successfully break through your opponent’s defences you’ll build up the power needed to perform devastating special moves with your Bankai-infused weapons. Just make sure your Spiritual Power and Soul Gauge aren’t low when you launch your special attacks, or it could harm you more than your enemy!
With seven game modes that include Arcade, Story, Versus, Mission, Training, Time Attack and Survival, Bleach is crammed full of challenges that will test your fighting skills to their limits. As you fight, you can switch between two planes of battle by pressing the L Button. Shifting between the two planes lets you chase after enemies who are trying to evade your attacks or offers you at least a few seconds of respite from a fierce foe. In the heat of battle you can also turn to the Touch Screen for help – tapping it to use your Spirit Card Deck and activate power-ups that boost your health, trigger a special attack or hinder your opponents.
The Spirit Deck Card can be added to in the Urahara Shop, where you’ll also find plenty of other items to purchase in exchange for the Kan you have earned from each victory. As you progress you will discover secrets of the Bleach universe and unlock new characters, costumes and dialogue voiced by the original anime actors.
For the ultimate challenge, fight against up to three friends wirelessly, either battling other Bleach: The Blade of Fate owners via Multi-Card Play or those who don’t own the game via Single-Card Play. There’s also the option of seeing how you shape up against Bleach fans the world over by going online and fighting one-on-one via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Only your fighting skills can determine your ultimate destiny in Bleach: The Blade of Fate!

Choose from 28 Bleach characters and fight in frantic battles by using powerful combinations and spectacular special moves.
Fight against up to three friends via Multi-Card Play or Single-Card Play and challenge a rival to a one-on-one battle online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
Tap your Touch Screen to activate special moves and select power-ups from your Spirit Card Deck.

During the  mission Point Man learned that the man wasn’t working alone. In fact,  the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic,  cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically  powerful mother, Alma Wade—products of Armacham’s perverse paranormal  experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the  standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pair’s homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly  accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its  inhabitants and almost all of Point Man’s squad mates.
For months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear  that Alma’s psychic influence survived—and worse, her paranormal power  is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony  repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her  bloodline and reunite her family. Armacham’s security force remains  violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city,  and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.
With the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots,  where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from  the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point  Man’s side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted,  yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?

In addition to Terry, Andy and Joe, who appeared in the original game, another five distinctive fighters gather from around the world to compete for the championship title. Also newly added are stage-specific hazards and the ability to perform desperation attacks when a character's strength is low. These particularly deadly techniques create the chance for a come-from-behind victory achieved with a single strike.
Moreover, the innovative two-line battle, which proved popular in the previous version, also has been radically enhanced. Pressing the weak-attack and strong-attack buttons simultaneously enables players to move their fighters to another line themselves, or to launch an attack that pushes opponents back to another line. This game mechanic, unique to this title in the series, allows the player to take advantage of the depth of the screen and create even more exciting bouts. Can you prove yourself the king of fighters again?
