The player's ultimate goal is to conquer the 25 regions of Ancient China and 
build an entire Empire using cunning diplomacy and uncompromising force. Before 
each battle, the player will meet with the war council to decide upon military 
and political policies for the kingdom; then it's time for war.

DYNASTY WARRIORS 5 EMPIRES gives armchair generals total control of their 
kingdom. Now, gamers can issue direct orders to each officer or signal general 
commands to officers on the field. Players will order when the army will take 
the offensive, defend their ground, or have all officers gather for an ambush. 
Gamers can also choose the officers for an attack force, entice captives into 
joining the kingdom's service and even expel officers from the kingdom. There's 
even greater authority over Government, Product Development, Diplomacy and 
Battle Tactics with the game's 25 new policies for a total of 75 in all.

Previous 3D fighters had only limited movement along the third axis, with sidesteps and rolls providing useful but unsustained lateral movement. In Soulcalibur, simply holding down a joystick direction causes the character to run in that direction. This gives the player a sense of freedom and deepens the strategy of the game. Soulcalibur also improved gameplay with ""forgiving buffering."" Buffering is executing the input for one move before the player's character has finished recovering from their previous move. It is important for executing quick strings of moves. Other games such as Tekken and Virtua Fighter have relatively strict buffering requirements, meaning expert timing is required to pull off many combinations, while Soulcalibur's relatively lenient buffering lets players focus more on the game and less on the controls.

The seek-and-solve fun of the Mystery Case Files™ series makes its first appearance on the Wii™ system with the Mystery Case Files™: The Malgrave Incident™ game. Players must unravel the mystery behind the enigmatic Malgrave  Island by using the Wii Remote™ controller to search for clues, solve  puzzles and find cleverly concealed items in multilayered hidden-object  scenes. The game's puzzle-based fun is enhanced by a captivating  storyline and new multiplayer modes that allow up to four friends to  test their sleuthing skills together.
FEATURES:

For the first time in the Mystery Case Files series,  hidden-object scenes have three visual layers, requiring players to zoom  and scroll to find certain objects using the Wii Remote controller.  Each hidden-object scene contains an inventory item that will help  players access new areas, solve other puzzles and unravel the mysteries  of Malgrave Island. In addition to puzzles, players will encounter  hidden collectible items that can unlock bonus stories.
To aid players in locating hard-to-find items, a hint button  in the form of an on-screen magnifying glass can be used to highlight  the area surrounding certain objects.
Three competitive multiplayer modes can be played with up to  four players. Each multiplayer match consists of three rounds. Players  can choose options such as each player's skill level and select a  hidden-object scene for each round. Multiplayer games include Swift Pick  (players compete to find hidden objects first), Tick Tick Pick (players  must find hidden objects and pass the bomb before it explodes) and  Classic Pick (players race to find the greatest number of hidden  objects). Additional controllers are required for multiplayer modes and  are sold separately.
In Adventure Mode, up to four people can play cooperatively to  solve the multilayered hidden-object scenes. The main player controls  the camera and additional players can join in on the adventure at any  time during normal game play.
A gripping storyline will keep players  engaged as they progress through the game's puzzle-based challenges.  Legend has it that a strange dust found on Malgrave Island has the power  to cure any illness. As players collect the dust, they also unearth the  island's many mysteries and raise questions about a wealthy  industrialist with a secretive past.

Ninja Blade™ is an action adventure game set within modern day Tokyo. Parasites known as alpha-worms have mysteriously appeared, unleashing a wave of human destruction as they rapidly spread east, reaching the shores of Tokyo. With the future of humankind hanging in the balance, an exclusive and elite team possessing highly specialized skills is formed to eliminate the enemy onslaught, and ultimately save mankind from complete obliteration.




Unique ninja abilities: Use your Ninja Vision to detect and analyze potential enemy weak points, secret paths, and hidden information within the environment, but be careful, as you are susceptible to extra damage while using your vision. And perform the todomé attack to destroy an enemy's core (heart), by dealing a fatal wound. Balanced and calculated use of both these abilities will be critical to progressing through the game.
Variety of weapons, tools, and Ninjutsu: Specialized ninja powers offer an enticing array of options. Varied environments force players to think strategically about which set of weapons and tools will be most effective at conquering the different levels. From dual wielding swords to grapple wire hooks to grenades, every item has distinctive features and characteristics, so choose wisely! Ninjutsu is a special power that results in an explosive electrical force to either stun enemies or protect oneself from attack. Only true Ninja Masters can achieve this technique.
Interactive quick-time events: Scattered throughout integral parts of the storyline, characters come across various quick-time events providing the opportunity to directly interact with in-game cutscenes. Quick reflexes are rewarded during the intense battles.
Modern realism: Ninja Blade offers a fresh twist to the classic ninja saga by basing all 3-D gaming maps directly from the actual skyscrapers and building tops in modern day Tokyo.

Pitted against the genetically enhanced soldiers of the Pacifican army, players will experience a revolution in 22nd-century warfare.  In utilizing the core gameplay mechanic of Fracture, a destructive technology known as Terrain Deformation, players are equipped with an arsenal of futuristic weaponry to strategically reshape their surroundings on the fly. Every action they perform dynamically reshapes the earth in ways no videogame has ever seen. When Briggs throws a tectonic grenade on a level battlefield, the ground blasts upward to provide access to an otherwise unreachable area. Moving on, when he comes across what appears to be an impenetrable structure, Briggs utilizes the alt-fire functionality on his rocket launcher to create enormous craters to burrow underneath the wall. Surrounded on all sides by enemies, Briggs heaves a vortex grenade, creating a swirling tornado-like mass of boulder, dirt and debris to dispatch his foes.

From the fastest frigates to the  gigantic, miles-long battleships, the player will customize all aspects  of his ships: weaponry, defense and support sub-systems, etc… each  customization affecting the very performances of the ship and the  special abilities available during battle. From battle to battle, the  admirals and crew of surviving ships will gain experience and  promotions, improving the battle-readiness of the ships for future,  bigger and more dangerous battles.

However, as you gain some wealth you will have to spread it around to gain esteem and help from the townsfolk, who can make your life much easier. You must keep in mind that everyone in the town has relationships, and how you treat one person will affect another person's attitude towards you.

Ever since the events at the end of Overlord: Raising Hell, the Overlord has been absent from the world and, without his firm grip on the kingdom, the lands have being conquered by the Glorious Empire. On the surface, the Glorious Empire is a civilisation driven by righteous politicians and supported with a mighty military force. However, in practice the Empire is decadent, corrupt and dangerous. And if there's one thing the Glorious Empire hates, it's magic and magical beings.  As the game opens, the Empire’s Inquisition is on the hunt for anyone who has magical resonance. In the Arctic wastelands, where Yetis roam, lies the snowy town of Nordberg. Here a young lad is singled out by the Inquisition and accused of possessing a magical force (what with him having strange glowing eyes and everything). However, as he is led off, the Empire guards come under attack from a band of strange little leathery, big-eared, yellow-eyed beasts: it’s the Minions! With a rousing cry of “Master” the devilishly charming critters carry the boy off – they’ve found their new Overlord.  After some years of intensive Minion training, players will step into the now-adult sized boots of the Overlord. Initially it’s a rag-tag band of Minions under his command but off they go, looting, destroying and laying waste to the lands around Nordberg, scoring victories where they can, before setting sights on the lands at the very heart of the Empire.  As the Overlord’s powers grow, the secrets of the Empire, and those of his own origins, will be revealed and then it’s time to go Minion maximus on the Empire’s collective ass. Players will be able to choose how to wield the Overlord’s evil forces. Do they plunder and pillage across the lands, burn cities on a whim in wild acts of destruction? Or do they follow a path of domination, enslaving towns and exerting their will upon the people? Only true despots will be able to make the ultimate choice between being a ‘destructive’ or a ‘dominating’ dark lord. "

Everything can be done with the dual analog sticks on the DUALSHOCK 2--the right stick controls rudder and aileron movement while the left stick controls pitch and banking. With a number of unique environments and realistic weather patterns such as subterranean caverns and intensive lightning storms, respectively, Sky Odyssey certainly keeps the on-screen flight interesting. Airplane selection ranges from WWII-era fighters (although they can't shoot) to UFOs and pretty much every age of flight in between.

NFL Fever is back and better than ever. The third installment of the exclusive Microsoft Game Studios football title for Xbox®, NFL Fever 2004 redefines the console football gaming experience.
You'll be impressed with the revamped A.I. of NFL Fever 2004, with significant offensive and defensive adjustments, animated NFL coaches (roaming the sidelines offering situational analysis), brand-new offensive playbook, totally reworked stadium models, and ""Read and Lead"" advanced passing.
From traditional single-player and multiplayer gaming to league and tournament play on Xbox LIVE®, NFL Fever 2004 is taking football gaming to the next level.



Revamped A.I.

Defensive adjustments: Just like in the NFL, winning the battle is about dominating on the defensive side of the ball. NFL Fever 2004 is in championship form this year with an improved secondary, including on-the-fly defensive adjustments and adaptive defensive players, geared up to take away the deep pass. To mount a formidable offensive campaign, gamers will need serious passing skills and the ability to dominate the line of scrimmage.
Getting back to the fundamentals: To win the ultimate prize, gamers must tackle and block with the best of them.NFL Fever 2004 brings it hard with revised tackling and blocking systems, impressive animations, and lots of increased action.
New offensive coordinator: Offensive play-calling can make the difference between a contender and a champion. NFL Fever 2004 makes it easy to dial up the best offensive plays with a new and more-intuitive play-calling interface. Other advancements on offense include trigger and ""Read and Lead"" passing, putting gamers right behind the center and allowing them to look off their receivers before going deep for six.

The Ultimate Football Experience

Xbox LIVE: NFL Fever 2004 will team up once again with Xbox LIVE to offer football fans across the world the ultimate gridiron challenge. Building on its much-acclaimed online rookie season, the new version of NFL Fever will provide downloadable content, roster updates, updated player ratings, tournaments, and an all-new ""Cheater Beater,"" destroying the hopes of less-honest opponents.
Head-to-head play: The four-controller multiplayer feature lets gamers battle head to head to earn bragging rights over their buddies. In addition, one-button control and variable game speed gives NFL Fever 2004 gamers total user control, letting them play their own game just the way they like it.

Offseason Acquisitions

New head coach: For gamers who want more strategy on a championship run, NFL Fever 2004 will introduce a new coach's feature to elevate the game. There will be animated coaches on the sidelines, and gamers should be on the lookout for situational advice from them. Coaches will analyze the game and provide insight that can make all the difference.
Strength and conditioning: During the offseason, NFL Fever 2004 fine-tuned its already tight and responsive controls to better deliver the intense action-packed pace of NFL Football. With 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound, downloadable music tracks, and the best gameplay in the business, NFL Fever 2004 is the team to beat this year.
Re-signing of Calabro and Pitts: Kevin Calabro and Ron Pitts return to NFL Fever 2004 to deliver all the hard-hitting action with informative play-by-play and analysis.
Even more serious graphics: NFL Fever 2004 sports a totally new look, from the flashy new user interface to detailed stadiums and players. NFL Fever's already impressive player models now have truly lifelike proportions, subtle shading, and real player faces.

Ever since the events at the end of Overlord: Raising Hell, the Overlord has been absent from the world and, without his firm grip on the kingdom, the lands have being conquered by the Glorious Empire. On the surface, the Glorious Empire is a civilisation driven by righteous politicians and supported with a mighty military force. However, in practice the Empire is decadent, corrupt and dangerous. And if there's one thing the Glorious Empire hates, it's magic and magical beings.As the game opens, the Empire’s Inquisition is on the hunt for anyone who has magical resonance. In the Arctic wastelands, where Yetis roam, lies the snowy town of Nordberg. Here a young lad is singled out by the Inquisition and accused of possessing a magical force (what with him having strange glowing eyes and everything). However, as he is led off, the Empire guards come under attack from a band of strange little leathery, big-eared, yellow-eyed beasts: it’s the Minions! With a rousing cry of “Master” the devilishly charming critters carry the boy off – they’ve found their new Overlord.After some years of intensive Minion training, players will step into the now-adult sized boots of the Overlord. Initially it’s a rag-tag band of Minions under his command but off they go, looting, destroying and laying waste to the lands around Nordberg, scoring victories where they can, before setting sights on the lands at the very heart of the Empire.As the Overlord’s powers grow, the secrets of the Empire, and those of his own origins, will be revealed and then it’s time to go Minion maximus on the Empire’s collective ass. Players will be able to choose how to wield the Overlord’s evil forces. Do they plunder and pillage across the lands, burn cities on a whim in wild acts of destruction? Or do they follow a path of domination, enslaving towns and exerting their will upon the people?

No longer are you forced to play as a ruling lord, RTK VII's revamped character system allows for a new degree of freedom and lets players live their own Three Kingdoms experience.

Gameplay:
Previous games in the Three Kingdoms series thrust players in the role of one of the many ruling lords. However, RTK VII also allows for individual officer play. Not as ambitious as the power-hungry Cao Cao? Simply pick a lowly government official or general and live your life as you choose and perhaps one day, ascend to the throne yourself. This character system allows for a completely new degree of freedom and lets players live their own Three Kingdoms experience.  "

It lasted for  a couple of hours and did not end in a victory for any side. There were  no sides left after it ended.
The Moscow Metro did fulfill its alternative purpose as an enormous  bomb shelter – it did so almost perfectly. Most of the people who  hurried inside at the sounds of an air raid alert survived. They seem to  be the only ones who did.
The humanity was all but extinguished in the apocalypse it brought  upon itself, its last remains reduced to hiding in holes waiting for an  unlikely miracle – or, which seems much more probable after all those  years, simply waiting for the last supplies to run out. After all, there  is little hope of ever getting out of the Metro, for the world outside  turned into a poisoned nightmare where a human cannot survive without a  gas mask. Having a gasmask does not make continued survival all that  much more probable – many areas are still too irradiated to enter, and  the Surface in general is teeming with hideous creatures born of  radiation.
Grudges and enmity are sure to arise in times of need, and in this  world they blossom like never before. The survivors, who could probably  stand a chance of overcoming all the hardships and ridding the world  above of the mutants, were they united, nevertheless break up into  antagonistic groups. These groups vary in numbers, power and beliefs,  some of them control whole Metro lines, while the others are basically  independent station-cities. But, regardless of how powerful or impotent  such a “state” is, they are vying for control of the now-scarce  resources.
And this is the harsh and unforgiving world as you, Artyom, know it.  You know of no other, since you were born a few years before the War and  the memories of the time when you still lived outside are vague at best  and growing ever weaker, displaced with horrors that are your daily  routine now. Ever since you came to live in the Metro, you never left  the confines of the station which became your home, but an impending  danger forces you to leave. You will have to brave untold dangers,  traverse pitch-dark tunnels and irradiated ruins of the once beautiful  city to find a way to help your home station in its hour of desperate  need, and, perhaps, do something much greater than that.

Since  romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent  meets his friends for their regular night of drinks.  Little does he  know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive,  irresistible freight train named Catherine.  Suddenly, he's hung over in  bed next to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, unsure about the  previous night's events.

The Horrors of Love--Vincent's waking  fears, doubts, pressures, and growing guilt about commitment and  fidelity now gleefully follow him into his dreams, manifesting as  horribly disfigured monsters and a ticking clock.
Between a Rock and a Soft Place--The player must navigate  Vincent through heavy moral decisions.  As in real life, hardly anything  is black and white.  What is the value of honesty?  What is the right  thing to do?  Either way, someone's going to get hurt.  Worse yet,  someone could die.
The Nightmare of Your Dreams--Under the watch of producer Katsura Hashino, acclaimed director of Persona 3 and Persona 4,  famed character artist Shigenori Soejima and master composer Shoji  Meguro create sights and sounds unlike anything else.  As unforgettable  and original as the game's narrative, Catherine's visual  direction and musical score define and perfectly complement Vincent's  terrifying ascent into the dizzying perils of love.

In an alternate present, vast swathes of  America have become no-go areas as the devastating effects of global  warming ravage the continent. Floods, storms, bush-fires, tornados and  hurricanes have driven people from towns and cities into safe zones as  extreme weather wreaks havoc, creating thousands of square miles of  dangerous uninhabitable areas. People turn to renewable energy in the  face of the destruction caused by global warming. But these danger zones  become a playground for a new breed of racer.

Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As  Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in  exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out  targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of  approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to  you.
HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The  experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued  with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the  Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode  5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived  on October 31st.
HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of  Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge  Packs and Contracts Mode.
An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that  we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that  are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time  in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they  escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that  you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an  Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never  return.
Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was  created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players.  You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to  complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements.  This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and  mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.
Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark  your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your  friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the  Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever  you load up the game.

I don’t want to shank it.” Earning the prestigious title of #1 Golfer of All Time can be a nerve racking process and it’s exactly what gamers will experience in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 as they fight off more than just pressure but also the man who’s trying to claim that title for his own, Tiger Woods.    In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06, gamers will attempt to settle the old debate of just who is the #1 Golfer of All Time. They’ll play golf legends such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan on their terms and in their specific eras (equipment, clothing and all). However, Tiger Woods is also there and is after the same goal. It’s your job to find him, stop him, and ultimately supplant him as the #1 golfer of every era. Duel with Tiger in multiple matches as he becomes your nemesis, chasing and even taunting you in every tournament.    Just as it is on the PGA TOUR®, the key to a good shot is execution and precision. In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 both analog sticks are used to give more control than ever over each shot. The left analog stick will continue to control the backswing and downswing, while the right analog stick, or “Shape stick”, controls ball trajectory and spin. Players are now challenged to focus on the impact point on the ball, while thinking more strategically before executing a shot. This also extends to putting where players will have to rely more on finesse and will need to move the analog stick only as far as needed to make the putt   The game of golf is as much psychological as it is physical and a key for gamers in 2006 will be maintaining confidence. With tension on every shot and mounting pressure to become the best, you can either keep your composure or lose it and become that embarrassing hack on the course. Based on good or bad shots or scores you make, a Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease based on the amount of confidence you possess.Dual Analog Swing and Putting   New advanced swing technique uses both analog sticks to “shape” shots. The left analog stick executes the swing and the right analog stick shapes the shot, controlling ball trajectory and spin. While putting, players will rely on “touch” and finesse as they swing the analog stick only as far as needed to make a putt. A new aiming mechanism also enables the user to line up and gauge putting speed.   Gamebreaker  Based on good or bad shots and scores you make, your Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease. When you hit certain thresholds you’ll earn the opportunity to trigger a Gamebreaker situation, giving you the ability to hit a longer and more accurate shot.   Wagering and Shot Calling  Call your shot before making it and reap the rewards. Players can elect to “call their shot” before making it, putting up a wager that they can pull it off.   Courses  Play a total of 15 courses (11 licensed and three fantasy courses) including the site of the 2005 British Open, St. Andrews Golf Links. Seven new licensed courses include TPC Sawgrass (Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.) Reflection Bay (Las Vegas, Nev.), Cog Hill Golf Club (Chicago, Ill.), Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club (Portland, Ore.), Sahalee Country Club (Seattle, Was.) and Doral Golf Resort (Miami, Fla).   PGA TOUR Players  Compete as or against 15 different PGA TOUR players including Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and new this year Chris DiMarco, Mike Weir, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald. Additionally, 12 new fantasy characters will challenge you on the links   EA SPORTS Online Competition  Play with up to four players across the country on the PlayStation 2 console or Xbox Live. Compete in Online Tournament events complete with money lists, full stat tracking, and league leaders.   Play a Career  In PGA TOUR Season mode for console versions, play along with the 52-week PGA TOUR calendar of events for up to 30 seasons. Obtain sponsorships from real golf equipment manufacturers throughout your career and drive to surpass Tiger Woods as #1 on the overall money list.   GameFace  Players will once again use the industry leading character creation technology GameFace to create their own golfer, outfit and build up their golfer’s attributes to attempt to become the #1 Golfer of All Time. New this year is the ability to choose your own voice for your character.   Reactive Tiger Proofing  The course will literally fight back. Courses will become more difficult as you score well, and will ease up if you play poorly.   Golf’s Best Commentators  David Feherty and Gary McCord make up the golf announcing Dream Team and provide their commentary and irreverent observations on each round.   --EA    "

Duck Amuck
Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck lets players wield the Nintendo DS stylus to        irritate, aggravate and infuriate their own Daffy Duck in humorous ways.        In the game inspired by the classic Duck Amuck cartoon, players will        compete against Daffy through a series of mini-games that range from        retro inspired favorites to modern, innovative gameplay interactions,        with the goal of driving Daffy's temperature, and his temper, through        the roof. Looney Tunes: Duck Amuck will also feature wireless game play        allowing players to not only gang up on Daffy as a team but also battle        each other in head-to-head competition.
 

 Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer-drive Daffy nuts          anytime, anywhere in the only game where you actually interact with          the one-and-only Daffy Duck.
 

 Daffy's goal is to outdo you. It's your job to outdo the Duck-use your          stylus to trick, taunt and tease Daffy until you send his temperature          meter through the roof.
 

 Engage your friends in outrageous Duck wars through Nintendo Wii and          DS connectivity.
 

 Be despicable! Progress through a huge variety of mini games ranging          from retro favorites to all-new experiences. As you do better, he gets          madder until he can't take it anymore!
 

 A completely original gaming experience custom made for the DS and the          Daffy Duck character! Where previous handheld character interaction          games have focused on care-giving, Duck Amuck plays like an          interactive cartoon.

Players are immersed in the world of the Lanzheim Continent, a conflict-ridden land deeply divided by a fierce civil war. Powered by the Unreal Engine3 and featuring character designs by famed Korean artist Hyung-Tae Kim, the game bears a striking visual style unlike any other RPG through its blend of photo-realism and Japanese manga influences. The deeply emotional story is driven by beautifully rendered CGI cut-scenes featuring fully voiced dialogue to draw players into the immersive experience.Delivering more than 40 hours of gameplay, Magnacarta 2 features a unique battle system which combines strategic turn-based battles and real-time gameplay, creating a fresh twist on the traditional RPG formula. The game seamlessly blends world navigation and battles as everything happens in the same environment with no load screens or abrupt changes in the action when a fight begins or ends. Players can utilize objects found in the environment to their advantage and likewise, creatures and field objects dynamically react to the player’s actions. A free-roaming camera further adds to the unrestricted interaction with the world. Players are also given flexible control over their party with the ability to pre-assign attributes for each AI character and the freedom to easily switch control between all the characters at any time.Magnacarta 2 features a variety of adaptable options to keep the action fresh throughout the game. By defeating monsters, players obtain Kamonds which can be used to enhance a variety of weapons as well as create new items. When players change their weapon, they take on a different fighting style that adapts all the related moves and skills to that weapon’s attributes. While normal skills can be performed by any player at any time, special moves require skilfully timed actions to exploit the rhythm of the battle to their advantage. The pinnacle of special moves is the over-drive mode where players can use the most powerful combination of skills at one time to perform devastating attacks to defeat enemies. KAN (magic), representing the four elements of nature (Wind, Water, Lightning and Fire), adds another dimension to gameplay whereby players generate KAN for use in battle and to affect environmental objects in various ways.

The ability of the successors of Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Seiken to kill  opponents in a single blow has been merged with Warriors-style  gameplay. This time, there will be even more exhilarating action than ever  before. In addition to the various techniques, taunts and special moves  of the previous game, new moves such as dodges and dashes will be added  as well. Experience life as a martial arts master as you predict an  enemy's attack and close the distance to finish him off before he can  even land a single punch.
The popular Dream Mode featuring original stories based on the characters has been completely revamped. Focused on the original manga, these stories will fill in the  gaps around the stages of the Legend Mode. Even characters that did not  get much coverage in the original manga will be given their time in the  spotlight, allowing you to enjoy plenty of hypothetical stories unique  to Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage 2.
This title features online co-op and versus play within Dream Mode. In versus play, players form teams and compete against the  other in a variety of missions, with the winners obtaining unique  bonuses. The character costume DLC that was so popular in the first game  also returns, and there are plans to make new stages available for  download in Dream Mode as well.  We are planning even more exciting things in regards to the online  features, so please stay tuned for more information as it becomes  available.

Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves ""Dumbledore’s Army,"" Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.

You know, the crazy zero-g first-person shooter that put you in the cockpit of a small ship and forced you to reenact the end of Return of the Jedi over and over again? Forsaken is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh.The game's simple scenario is set on a postapocalyptic Earth. Most of the planet is in ruins, complete with loads of goodies, ripe for the taking. You play a scavenger on a hoverbike, and you'll traverse military installations, nuclear reactors, refineries, temples, and more in search of gold and crystals. This may sound like a cakewalk, but Earth's automated defense systems are still intact, littering your path with all kinds of annoying drone ships, tanks, and turrets. The single-player levels in this version of the game are different from the levels in the PC and PlayStation versions. Some of them require you to simply destroy every enemy on the level, while others pit you against huge boss ships.The weaponry in Forsaken is unique. Each weapon has three levels of power, depending on how many power pods you've found. The Suss gun is a spread-fire weapon that quickly shoots a mess of projectiles in your enemy's direction. The Trojax is a charged weapon that gains power (and sucks ammunition) when you hold down the fire button. Transpulse shots can bounce off walls, making them good for surprise attacks in multiplayer games. The Beam Laser simply emits two monstrous beams of death. It requires pinpoint accuracy, but it does insane amounts of damage. Secondary weapons include the Scatter missile, which causes the victim to drop all of his weaponry. The Multiple-Fire Rocket Launcher quickly spits out tons of small missiles. The Solaris homes in on its target. The Gravgon missile creates a vacuum at its point of impact, sucking enemies into its gravitational field and holding them in place for you to take out at will. The Titan is the most devastating weapon in the entire game and will frequently take you out as well if you aren't careful. There are also three different types of mines that will help you keep enemies off your tail and a nitro boost that will allow you to escape from sticky situations.The control in Forsaken 64 is very well done. The game moves quite fast, but once you've grasped the control scheme, you'll easily be able to keep up with the action. The multiplayer in Forsaken 64 is pretty well done. Even on a four-player split screen, you can still make out what's going on, although long-range rocket shots get pretty hard to make. You can replace any missing players with computer-controlled deathmatchers, so you can just take on three CPU opponents instead of actually having to deal with humans.Between the various multiplayer options and the great single-player mode, Forsaken 64 comes out a real winner. Save for Rare's Goldeneye 007, it easily defeats the other first-person shooters currently available for the N64. "

An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player’s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome.
The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero’s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Links, the best-selling golf franchise for the personal computer, has been rebuilt—from the ground up—exclusively for the Xbox video game system.
 
Links® 2004 delivers one of the most realistic and competitive golf experiences for Xbox. Golf fans worldwide can compete online in friendly matches with old golfing buddies or compete in tournaments against the best golfers in the world via Xbox Live.
 
Links 2004 also features top championship courses and top professionals, including cover athlete Sergio Garcia.
 


The thrill of real competition: Take your golf swing online, using Xbox Live. Enter one of the most comprehensive online golf arenas ever created. Compete against the best players from all over the globe, track your stats, or simply play a social round of golf with friends—all from the comfort of your living room.
Playing like the pros: Feel like real pros, as you compete in tournaments broadcasted in a remarkably realistic TV-style presentation.
Tour of duty: Work your way up the professional ladder online or in the challenging Tour Mode. See who really is the best in the world. Crowded galleries of fans will cheer you on, as you compete for tournament purses and tour recognition.
Championship courses: Links 2004 features some of the most luxurious and challenging golf courses in the world, including Greywolf (Canada), New South Wales (Australia), and the Four Seasons Resort Aviara (California).
Detailed golf environments: Hit the sweet spot for a 300-yard drive, and roll in a 20-foot putt for a birdie—all while enjoying the dew-covered fairways and crosscut greens. Links 2004 is the ultimate golf experience. The top courses from around the world come to life with animated water, ocean surf, 3-D trees, divots, galleries of golf fans that react to your shots, and golf course wildlife, such as birds, ducks, squirrels, and gophers. The lifelike courses feature sun-cast shadows that change, depending on the time of day; birds that are spooked when a ball hits a tree; and ducks that will scatter when a ball hits the drink.
Control over each and every shot: The Real-Time Swing feature gives you complete control over every shot. Advanced players have the opportunity to draw, fade, punch, chip, or flop to win a hole. The left thumbstick acts as the club, with ball physics factoring in speed, tempo, direction, and course conditions in real time.
The golfers: Play as a golf superstar, such as Sergio Garcia, to perfect your game. Or, create a character with unique physical characteristics, skills, apparel, and personality. Be aggressive and take risks, or be conservative and lay up. Links 2004 has a personality to suit every type, and each character's celebrations and audio commentary will match their personality.
