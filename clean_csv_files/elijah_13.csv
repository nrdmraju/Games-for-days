Upon entering the tomb,  Carter removes the mythical Staff from its resting place and  inadvertently triggers a trap cursing them both and unleashing the evil  god Set. But the staff also awakens the gods Horus and Isis, the son and  wife of Osiris.

As Lara and her companions fight their way across  the sands and through ancient tombs, they will face gods and monsters  of myth and legend.

He sets off in search of his past. His only clues are the number 13 tattooed on his collarbone and the key to a safety-deposit box in one of New York's most prestigious banks.
The passport he finds in the safe at the bank reveals his identity. His name is Steve Rowland and he's a captain in the United States army. Moments after making this discovery, he's arrested by colonel Amos, director of the FBI's anti-terrorist department and accused of the murder of William Sheridan, the 43rd president of the United States. In evidence, he's shown the enlargement of a snapshot in which he appears holding a sniper's rifle. The weapon is aimed at the presidential cortège.

Theme Hospital allows you to build an environment within a hospital, which will attract patients with comical complaints, illnesses, emergencies, and diseases. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, which is similar to that of Theme Park in many ways. The player has no direct control over the patients that wander the hospital, although game play largely centres on influencing their actions in one way or another.
Each level consists of an empty hospital to plan and design, with set goals in the fields of financial attainment, patients cured, percent of patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present.

Thousands are killed and the kingdom is in ruins. Demonic creatures from the underworld have emerged and the Queen of Duhan has disappeared into the labyrinths beneath the castle. The labyrinths are said to hold the greatest treasures in the land, but will you survive long enough to enjoy them? It is now up to you to face the ultimate challenge: can you find the Queen in time and rid the kingdom of the evil that has befallen it? Fight on, brave warrior! Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land introduces a unique gameplay mechanic, called the Trust System, which gives you the ability to use special group combat techniques known as Allied Actions. Like the Converge Attack and Sacred Cross, these Allied Actions are critical to success in battle, as you often run into groups of enemies that outnumber you 2 to 1. The Trust System takes into account many factors that contribute to overall party unity including your successes/failures in battle, the personality of each party member and even who your characters stand by in battle. Ultimately, without these special attacks you will stand little chance of fending off the attacks of the enemy horde.  Can you handle it?

There are essentially two games in one as the game has a single-player story mode as well as the classic multiplayer mode.
In the Story Mode, explore Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, with the stylus. Touch the area where you want to move and your Bomberman will go there. You can explore at different speeds depending on where you touch. Bomber Island is comprised of four zones. Spade Zone is a port city. Diamond Zone is mountainous. Club Zone features jungles and deserts. Heart Zone is filled with aquatic vistas.
Your explorations will inevitably lead you to one of 36 different one-to-four-player mini-games. One game asks you to fish for bombs by drawing ""lines"" with the stylus from a boat to a designated color of bomb. Another challenges you to blow out lit fuses through the Nintendo DS'™ mic. Most mini-games take advantage of both screens, enhancing the action.
Every time you complete a mini-game, you earn a piece. Pieces open gates all over Bomber Island. By opening gates, you can reach new places. Completing a mini-game in Story Mode also unlocks the mini game in an Attractions Mode, where you can later replay all unlocked games either by yourself or with friends. With DS Download Play capability, you only need one Bomberman Land Touch! cartridge for up to 4 people.

Once the victim of Heinrich's blade by the order of the game's antagonist, Dr. Faust, Gretchen now has him under her control as the two must work together to rid the land of the supernatural foes who are cursing its people with the black spell of death.

Armed with a razor sharp scythe and explosive witchcraft, players will use these tools with spectacular effects in order to return civility to the land.  As players succeed in their journey, they can deal tremendous damage to their on-comers or unleash a gruesome finisher by coordinating the efforts of Heinrich and Gretchen. However, players must also keep a close eye on Gretchen as her mortality is the key to the duo's survival as Heinrich can never be vanquished. It's time to let the combos fly and lay waste to the hordes of darkness with a liberal dose of medieval panache. "

Set in 1791 during the twilight days of Japan's feudal Edo period, Edge of Destiny reveals a society on the brink of collapse, as encroaching Western influences threaten to overrun the ancient, once-hidden culture of lords, serfs, and samurai.

In the midst of this chaos and upheaval, the Lord of Amori-han bravely chooses to raise an orphaned European princess as his own daughter. This brave young girl, Suzuhime, matures to become a warrior representing both East and West. The insidious Golba, a veteran of the U.S. Revolutionary War, ranks paramount among her foes, and a cadre of like-minded fighters flock to Japan to halt his dark plans for global domination. Familiar faces from past Samurai Shodown games (including Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Ukyo) battle alongside newcomers from all corners of the Ear th to put an end to Golba’s villainous designs. Victory on this crucial conflict comes by any means necessary -- even if it means ending a melee with grisly dismemberment or decapitations! "

This epic journey propels Death  across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War,  the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in  Darksiders. Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the  series is primarily a hack ‘n slash adventure. The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Gameplay:Viewed from a side on perspective, in your turn you get to move your Worm around to get into a position to fire at other Worms. Depending on the settings you may have a set time limit to complete your move. Once your turn is over, another team goes and when it gets back round to your turn, you use one of your other Worms. Teams are customisable because you can change the AI of the computer teams and even change how much health each team of Worms has to compensate for the players' skill level. If a Worm falls into water/acid/fire or goes off screen (either by jumping or being blown off) then you lose the Worm regardless of how much health he had.
Features:
Over 15 different weapons and abilities to choose from each turn 
Teams, weapons and time limits per team are all customisable

Cold War tensions continue to ease, and the Vietnam War is in its final days.
The legendary mercenary Big Boss leads an army that belongs to no nation. Under the guise of a nuclear inspection by the IAEA, a hostile force known as XOF launches a surprise attack on Mother Base, Big Boss's base of operations. His soldiers put up a desperate fight, but their efforts are in vain, as Mother Base falls.
A moment after Big Boss escapes the area by helicopter, an intense light appears in the sky, and a wormhole opens over the base. The wormhole begins to suck up everyone and everything left, transporting them to some parallel world. A soldier who helped Big Boss get away is almost pulled into it as well, but manages to escape. A close friend of the soldier, however, isn't as lucky.
The soldier then mysteriously loses consciousness, waking up six months later in a facility belonging to Wardenclyffe Section, a secretive research organization of the U.S. government. A member of this organization, a man known as Goodluck, gives the soldier a special assignment with the following order:
""You don't get to sit this one out. You're already infected with that lifeform I was telling you about.""

Waiting on the other side is a hellish landscape where victims of the infection have transformed into grotesque creatures known as Wanderers.

Pictures feature film and more than 60 years of DC Comics' lore, Superman Returns™: The Videogame will create the ultimate open-world super hero experience.  As the Man of Steel™, you'll hone your unworldly super powers such as Flight, X-Ray Vision, Heat Vision, Super Hearing, Super Strength, Super Speed, and Super Breath to fight villains that only Superman™ can defeat. Explore your super powers to discover new uses and combinations: use Heat Vision to melt a rogue car or as a focused laser-like beam to cut through thick metal; use Super Breath to move heavy objects or freeze villains into solid ice. You can also combine powers and interact with your environment; for instance, freeze water spouting from a broken fire hydrant into a giant icicle with your Super Breath and use your Super Strength to hurl it at an enemy.  Get ready to take flight, as Superman Returns' revolutionary new mechanics allow you to take full command of your aerial maneuvers. You're not limited to flying over 800 mph (faster than a speeding bullet™) — you can also corral your enemies, perform stunning in-air acrobatics, instigate Super Speed missile-like attacks, and much more.  In Superman Returns: The Videogame, you explore and protect the truly living city of Metropolis — one that is not only expansive (with 80 sq miles and over 10,000 buildings), but also changes dynamically with you as you affect gameplay. Citizens will run away in terror from newly-erupting danger and also exit their cars to cheer and snap photos as you fly overhead to save them.  Superman may be invincible, but Metropolis is not. Player choice matters, as Metropolis' destruction will affect your ability to progress. You must face the internal conflict facing Superman at every turn: will you pause your pursuit of super villains to stop a massive tornado sweeping through the city and save its civilians? Every decision made is critical to Metropolis' existence and can affect the collateral damage meter, which ultimately keeps the player in the game.

Rogue is a Souther G.I.; a genetically engineered super-soldier, designed to fight against the Nort Republic on the poisoned planet of Nu Earth. Each G.I has a ‘biochip’ implanted, which continually records their persona and training so that upon death they can be returned to base and recloned. Rogue’s closest buddies, Helm, Gunnar and Bagman die in their first action, betrayed by a Souther General, during what became known as the Quartz Zone Massacre. Their biochips were installed into Rogue’s Helmet, Rifle and Backpack. They now have control over their respective equipment, providing Rogue with a four-man combat team against the Norts. With Rogue, now the sole survivor of the massacre, his overall objective is simple – find and kill the Traitor General who betrayed the G.I’s!
The game fully utilizes the Wiimote interface to provide an immersive gameplay experience with features such as a ‘Twist’ zoom sniper mode. A variety of powerful weapons can be used as well as additional firepower provided by Rogue’s equipment. Gunnar provides weapon modification, Bagman can deploy mines to provide cover, and Helm can create a controllable holographic projection of Rogue to confuse enemies in case of an ambush.
The game combines aspects of stealth, cover, and run-n-gun gameplay into 13 action packed single player environments. There is also a fully featured multiplayer mode allowing up to 4 players to compete in a split-screen co-op play. Missions extend up to four kilometres and are designed to allow the player to explore their environment, scope out the enemy and find the best path for their style of attack.
Features

Margot has devised a set of fiendish wordbased puzzles to test your vocabulary, spelling and general language skills. No two games will ever be the same as you pit your wits against the clock to create words from randomly generated letters in order to maximise your score.

Six different word puzzles to tackle: Word Link, Word Mine, Hyper Text, Word Race, Word Safe and Word Search. All of these games present a unique challenge and players will have to master them all to become the ultimate Word Brain. 


Word Brain mode pits the player against all six of the games in succession and records their score so that they can track their progression throughout the game. 


Easy to use menus and gameplay make Margot’s Word Brain a game that is accessible to gamers of all ages and experience levels. 


Follows on from the success of the Brain Training phenomenon and will attract fans of games such as My Word Coach.

Thanks to the expanded 'Group Control Engine', you're no longer limited to directing the action from the perspective of unit officer - now you can dictate the direction of the unit as a whole, enabling both macro and micro-management of your forces.
The plot follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga, the leader who attempted to bring all of Japan 'under a single sword' ('tenka-fubu') at the end of the Warring States period. It's a dream he never achieved, but now history can be re-written with Kessen III&.
In addition to the new control features and a solid storyline (supported by over 120 minutes of movie sequences), Kessen III features twice as many battles as its predecessors. Such quantity, when combined with consistently high quality, makes for a detailed and engrossing historical epic.

Now it is your turn to step into the arena, commanding a mythical force of fantastical creatures.
Wrath Unleashed puts you in command of one of four demigods, each representing one of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. Each has chosen a side in the struggle of order vs chaos but, whoever you choose, you will have an army of mythological creatures at your disposal. From the Light Order Unicorn to the Dark Chaos Demon, you'll see familiar and not so familiar monsters here, all of which have magic and melee attacks at their disposal.
The game is broken into two distinct play modes - turn-based strategy, and fights between warring creatures. Each turn takes place on a huge battleground, broken down into tactical hexes, on which you move your creatures, cast spells, and try to capture strategic temples, citadels and mana points. As creatures clash on this board, Wrath Unleashed turns into a fighting game, with you controlling your monsters as they square off against each other. A torrent of magic, melee and mayhem is released as they fight to secure you victory.
As well as a 16 mission campaign, there are various versus modes for you to explore with up to four players competing simultaneously. Whichever way you choose to play, Wrath Unleashed provides plenty of strategy and excitement for the mythologically minded.

Beyond Good & Evil has a variety of elements from various genres of games, and is not strictly an adventure game. Although it has strong adventure elements it also contains many elements from RPGs, Stealth and Puzzle games. The game was very highly recieved yet had poor sales which led to the sequel being post-poned and possibly even cancelled.

RTK IX is vastly different from previous games in the series. Most notably, players immediately assume the rank of a Ruler. Traditionally reserved as the highest rank in the series, the role of Ruler will test your leadership, management, and strategy skills.
Gameplay:As a Ruler, one of the keys to maintaining authority is a strong corps of loyal officers, so RTK IX’s Officer Development System has been enhanced with a new point and item system. With the new point system, players earn points to increase officer abilities and skills. With the item system, certain items can further an officer’s development, heighten intelligence or improve his abilities in war. Players can now use save data from Dynasty Warriors 4, Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends or Dynasty Tactics 2 to obtain a new officer.   RTK IX’s combat has evolved in many ways and takes place at a much higher tempo than previous games in the series. Players can handle political and military affairs at the same time, and as a result use diplomacy while under attack or shift strategies against enemy units in the midst of combat. Players can also build towers to defend bases or construct obstacles to hold back invasions. Furthermore, certain troop formations can activate specific tactics such as ""Arrows"" or ""Crossbow,"" and with the new Tactical Combo System, players can set officer formations to unleash a barrage of tactics.   In addition to officers, foreign tribes are now a pivotal force and can help players protect their dominion. The ""Wuwan"", ""Xi Qing"", ""Shanyue"", and ""Nanman"" tribes have powerful armies, yet refrain from expanding their territories. If a player establishes relations with a tribe, the tribe may send reinforcements if needed. However, if the player declares war against them, the tribes may attack.
Features:* New Personality Dependent System affects an officer’s response to player commands.   * New display shows capital, troop movements, geography, enemy strongholds, and more all on a single map.   * 20 historical and fictional scenarios with multiple story endings and epilogues.   * Challenge Scenarios where players must clear a mission within a limited time.   * Character-specific events and clear bonuses.   * 34 special event sequences.   * Over 30 different tactics and 12 military formations.   * A stirring score with 23 orchestrated pieces.   * Play with up to 8 characters at once.   * Updated Tutorial System.

Ember is the essence of magic and the keystone of alchemy; it lures the restless with promises of power and riches. Miners burrowed deep beneath the dirt streets of Torchlight, discovering veins of the ore richer than any found in living memory- but they were not the first to covet these mines. The miners broke through into the buried past, a dangerous labyrinth of caverns and ruined civilizations, twisted creatures and the bones of those who came before. Evil bubbles up from the depths and threatens to overrun this town as it has so many others. The heart of a villain has infused the Ember, and his darkness seeps through the veins. To survive, the townspeople must break the cycle of destruction; they need a champion who can destroy the evil at its root. Removing the source of the rot may purify the Ember, but it is a long and perilous journey. The champion must battle through rock and fire, through lost cities and ancient tombs, into the palace of the villain himself.
The adventure is set in the mining settlement of Torchlight, a boomtown founded on the discovery of rich veins of Ember – a rare and mysterious ore with the power to enchant or corrupt all that it contacts. This corruptive power may have dire consequences however, and players set out into the nearby mountains and depths below to discover the full extent of Ember’s influence on the civilizations that have come before.
Players will choose from among three character classes, and venture from the safety of the town of Torchlight into randomly generated dungeon levels, with a huge variety of creepy monsters, endless variations of loot to find, and quests to complete. The endless randomization ensures a long-lived gameplay experience.(Developer) "

Speed Zone is the first Wii game to support up to four of the Speed Force Wireless wheels.A 3D, three-sided pyramid menu provides access to the game’s 30 levels. The pyramid menu displays 10 Solo tracks, 10 Race tracks, and 10 Battle arenas. Initially, only the lowest-tier levels are unlocked. Players need to achieve a number of goals to unlock level links to the more challenging levels above on the pyramid menu.In Solo mode, players try to ignite jet thrusters with boost pads to accelerate ""into the zone,” with phantom cars and racing lines to help set lap records. When a player beats the targeted Zone-Time, the next level unlocks. Players can find secret pickups and shortcuts and earn bonus rewards by setting new best times. Bonus rewards can be used to buy new cars, skins, aerodynamic aides, and performance upgrades, which give the player the opportunity to go even faster when revisiting levels.In Race mode, players compete against seven computer-controlled AI cars. Players unlock the next level by finishing in the top three (or better, depending on the difficulty level).Battle Mode is an all-out, futuristic demolition derby, using some spectacular weapons. Players can fry opponents with a lighting gun or shatter them with an overactive chain-gun complete with flying shells – not to mention a plethora of other weapons, including rockets, missiles, lasers, and mines. Defensive pick-ups include shock-jumps, shields, and a stealth cloak. "

In the wake of one of North Korea's worst famines, an insidious North Korean general influences the government to secretly divert humanitarian aid to beef up its army, slowly gaining power in the process.
Fearful that North Korea is amassing huge quantities of military weapons, the new Chinese regime eliminates arms sales to North Korea. In response, the North Korean government initiates secret overtures to Russia, who strikes a quiet alliance. In the midst of another North Korean famine, food riots begin rocking the countryside, and the rogue North Korean general assumes complete control of the army. Blaming China for the famine, he begins charging north to seize Chinese territory with tacit support from its new Russian ally.
China moves to respond, but limits the level of escalation, fearing open conflict with Russia and a possible nuclear exchange. Instead, China officially agrees to a multinational force to safeguard the China-North Korean border. Unofficially, the Ghosts and other special forces go in. Their mission: cripple the North Korean threat and depose the rogue general.

 ONLINE: Play online with friends,  challenging them in the Single Stage, Single Rally or Championship. Your  results will affect your ranking online as you try to become the best  rally driver in the world. This year, the Super Special Stage mode will  also be available online... so you can challenge opponents in a 1on1  competition with updated online rankings, that will show the best  ""duelists"" in the world 

 PHOTO MODE: Starting also this year  players can capture the most exciting moments of  races, through the  new photo mode. Just put the game on pause, frame the car and shoot.   Then if you really want to show off apply some of the many special  visual effects. 

 REWIND EFFECT: Didn't take the  corner quite right, no problem?  With this new game feature you can  rewind time and return a few seconds before it all went wrong. The  feature also helps inexperienced drivers master new tracks 

Improvements

 CO-DRIVER: With a passion to make this the  most authentic rally experience. The team at WRC2 took direction from  professional co-drivers so the in-game notes have been improved in every  rally, increasing the levels of information and making the timing of  co-driver instructions as accurate as possible. 

 REAL SOUNDS: Bring the roar of the engines of the WRC cars into your living room!  					Thanks to the many different recording sessions performed in  the field, the in-game sounds of cars have been made even more faithful  to the real ones! 

 GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of each Special Stage  has been improved thanks to meticulous attention to detail making the  streets even more faithful to those of the World Rally Championship.  This year you will face tight hairpin turns, rough terrains, winding  curves and sudden changes to the surface conditions 

 COCKPIT VIEW: The cockpit view has been  further enhanced with the introduction of the ""look to apex."" During a  hairpin nothing can escape you. In fact, the view automatically pans  towards the path you're driving, simulating the movements of the head of  a real driver, further enhancing the feeling of realism 

 GRAPHICS AND LIGHTNING: Graphics and  environmental lighting are now showing more vivid colors, making all the  tracks more real and realistic. The environment is rich in vegetation,  which produces some wonderful effects of light and shadow. The  introduction of the ""haze"" effect also enhances the scenery. 

 REAL ENVIRONMENT: Powerful vehicles, crumbling  roads, changing conditions ... the new driving experience will allow  you to immerse yourself in the world of rally as if you were really  behind the wheel of a 300 BHP vehicle, on off-road trails, on any kind  of surface. 

 PHYSICS AND DAMAGES: In WRC 2 we have  technically improved the physics. Now the car behaves even more  realistically thanks to a new suspension management system that allows  the car to be more responsive to the undulation of the surface. 			The driving experience is much more fun, realistic and enjoyable.  And we also introduced new graphics for damage thanks to an enhanced  system that allows more realistic and detailed deformation following  collisions.

Somewhere in Japan, the Great Hakurei Barrier separates Gensokyo from the rest of the world.
Although it has no ocean, it contains an underground world called Hell, and a world in the sky above called Heaven.It  is said that things that have been forgotten by the outside world, as  well as living things that have gone extinct, find their way to  Gensokyo.
In this world of abundant nature, which has not be sullied by  industrialization, humans and yokais live together...though not  peacefully,and disputes are always erupting. The yokais are always causing incidents that stir up all of Gensokyo.
To resolve these issues, they have implemented ""Spell Card Rules,"" a.k.a. ""Playing Danmaku,""which allows humans and yokais to fight against each other fairly.
Because of these rules, yokais cause trouble more often, and humans have to resolve these problems daily.
This is a normal day in Gensokyo, where Touhou Genso Rondo: Bullet Ballet takes place...
Now, let's fight our way through the hectic and fun events that make up a normal life in Gensokyo!

Throughout the warriors journey they discover that these bracelets possess great power and decide to use them to their own advantage, with some individuals using them for their own hidden schemes.
The players can now experience the inaugural appearance of magic abilities, allowing characters to wield phenomenally powerful and visually impressive attacks against their most challenging foes. These new-found powers come from the gods’ most divine artifact; the Sacred Treasures. In this distorted, merged version of their worlds, all warriors are unexpectedly gifted with a Sacred Treasure that fuels their spell-casting attacks. Alongside their legacy moves and special attacks, they can now cast ranged and targeted spells, or even combine their powers with those of an ally for truly devastating blows thanks to the return of local couch co-op and online play.

While retaining many of the features that have become hallmarks of the Romance series, RTK IX (ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS IX) is vastly different from previous games in the series. Most notable is that players immediately take the rank of a Ruler. Traditionally reserved as the highest rank in the series, the role of Ruler will test any player's leadership, management and strategy skills. 
RTK IX's combat has evolved in many ways and takes place at a much higher tempo than previous games in the series. Players can handle political and military affairs at the same time, and as a result use diplomacy while under attack or shift strategies against enemy units in the midst of combat. Players can also build towers to defend bases or construct obstacles to hold back invasions. Furthermore, certain troop formations can activate specific tactics such as ""Arrows"" or ""Crossbow,"" and with the new Tactical Combo System, players can set officer formations to unleash a barrage of tactics.

In a shooter that recreates the brutal reality of the modern combat experience in stunning detail, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising will challenge players to survive the chaos and rapidly evolving situations of modern warfare in a new contemporary theatre.
Players will experience the intensity, diversity and claustrophobia of a present day conflict from the unique perspectives of an infantry marine and a Special Forces officer, each engaged against the full force of the Chinese PLA on the huge open-world island of Skira. Gameplay simulates an immense conflict between advanced forces and provides unparalleled scope with different military disciplines, vehicles and equipment for players to utilise.

The character damage system authentically depicts the terrible wounds and injury from modern weapons to communicate the lethality of combat.

Unscripted missions will task players with real objectives, such as laying down covering fire, covering a friendly unit's retreat or conducting short-range recon patrol. Armed with cutting edge military hardware, players will need to balance brute force with intelligent use of tactics.
Squad-Based CombatAs an epic single and multi-player campaign weaves the narrative, players will fight as infantry soldiers in battle, drive tanks in armoured assaults, and infiltrate the enemy in covert special operations utilizing a wide variety of realistic military weapons from knives and rifles to machine guns and grenade launchers.
The battlefield is the 220km2 island of SkiraLocated off the eastern coast of Russia, north of Japan. This oil-rich Russian-controlled island stands on the brink of war. An airborne division of the People's Liberation Army of China (PLA) lands to claim the island as the sovereign possession of the People's Republic. Russia turns to the US for support aid and they're quick to respond. Sending in the USS Iwo Jima, a battalion of US Marines launch an assault on the strung out but dug-in Chinese force. Can the situation be defused before this flashpoint turns white hot and an all-out global war between the superpowers erupts?
Redefines the Size of BattleThe 220km2 battlefield gives players a multitude of tactical decisions on how to best accomplish missions. Densely packed with environment detail and objects, valleys, mountains, coastlines, towns, villages and industrial complexes all combine to deliver a rich and challenging tactical environment.

Those of you who aren't familiar with the original NES game and aren't fans of puzzle-driven RPG games might just want to skip this one. The game is played from a first-person perspective, putting you in the shoes of a halfling by the name of Del who is mistakenly thrown into the dungeon of Castle Shadowgate. While you're waiting for your punishment, you find an escape route - this is where your journey begins and the story unfolds.The gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward: All you really do is guide Del through the vast castle collecting just about anything that you can get your hands on. Each and every item you come into contact with has a place or purpose, although more often than not those places or purposes are a little strange. Each item and area you enter come with a little description that gives you more insight than you might get at first glance. In addition, you come across lots and lots of books that explain various things about the world you're in - some books are practical and to the point, offering valuable instructions, while others are more elusive in the clues they give.Visually, the game is well below the average of anything we've seen on the N64 in quite a while. The game has the flat, grainy, washed-out look of a first-generation title. Aside from a few characters that you encounter, the game is literally devoid of any animation at all. In some of the areas it is hard to tell that objects you should be interacting with are even there. Most of the objects you pick up look fairly representative of what they are supposed to be, although there are a few instances where you're not quite sure what it is until the written description pops up on the screen. From an audio standpoint, Shadowgate 64 isn't anything all that great. The music, while fitting, changes when you go from areas like the sewers to the library, and even then it sounds pretty much the same. The sound effects of different objects like the clanging of a pipe against a wall or the turn of one of the pages in a book sound rather authentic and breathe add a bit of life into the otherwise uneventful game. In the end, Shadowgate 64 is a very slow-paced game that has a lot of nostalgic value for fans of the original game, but it soon becomes increasingly frustrating and uninteresting. I personally enjoyed the game for the first few hours, but once I started coming across puzzles that were similar to ones I had already done, the game began to get stale. The lack of any prolonged contact with other characters in the game and the repetitive musical score doesn't only make the game feel boring but lonely as well. I would have to say that only hard-core RPG fans who have lots of patience should spend the time playing Shadowgate 64. "

The IAG, the agency in charge of protecting Theophilus, has dispersed its forces across the galaxy following a surprise attack that eliminated many of its troops in one fell swoop. Sho, a human-alien hybrid known as a 'VIPA' and member of the IAG, has already dealt with such a threat before and, realising that the IAG's reduced army won't stand a chance, goes on a search for more help...
This help arrives in the form of new playable character Feanay, a fellow VIPA with her own special powers. During the game, you'll sometimes have the ability to switch between Sho and Feanay and attempt new character-specific missions.
The fast-paced shooting action recalls Koei's Dynasty Warriors series, with thousands of enemies to take on with a variety of weapons and NeoPsionic (psychic 'wave') attacks. Weapons and powers can be mixed and matched to devastating effect - it's actually possible to wipe out hundreds of aliens in seconds with 1,000+ hit combos.
Non-linear game progression means that you can be selective with your missions - even if you decide to decline a certain task, you'll still be able to progress and develop your character's attributes and arms, and then return once you feel that you're powerful enough to tackle it. "

With power steering they're so easy to park, weave in and out of stationary traffic or nip out to the country for a spin. But let's face it, a small car is a functional thing, right? It's useful, practical and basically gets you from A to B . . . 
. . .Well, yes, but then there's the small cars in Circuit Breakers. Ever fancied driving a mini through the Grand Canyon? You can with this new take on the concept of the top-down racer. With a wide variety of circuits, each based on a different landscape, the only problem with driving a mini down the Grand Canyon is that you have the other cars to deal with. And in Circuit Breakers, roaring past your opponents in a souped-up monster-car simply can't be done. All the cars conform to the same performance specifications (although chassis design varies greatly); the way to win races is by nudging your way onto the racing line whilst at the same time pushing your opponents off the track. And because all the cars have the same power, the races are bound to be close-run.
Dotted around the circuits as well are power-ups which you can also use to thwart your opponents . . .Spread an oil slick on the track, engage a rocket booster for a burst of speed, shrink the size of your car to get through those tight spaces, or simply blow the other cars up with a missile. Getting these little tricks means being first to pick them up on the way round.
Circuit Breakers has an impressive depth of multi-layered levels with some lovely 3D undulation going on, and with Dual Shock control (analogue and vibration) you feel all the bumps.

The Wii version was released in all regions but the PS2 version was not released in Japan.
It was originally called Kiki KaiKai 2 and was conceived as a PS2 sequel to Taito's Kiki KaiKai series (Pocky & Rocky outside Japan). The game was cancelled when developer Starfish lost the licence and later became a Wii game known as Kiki Kai World.
To avoid legal issues the graphics and theme were changed. Lead character Miko was replaced with Sayuki, a snow goddess.
There are different storylines in the single and multiplayer games but gameplay is the same.
In the single player game Sayuki visits a nearby village and learns that the boy she loves has been cursed and cannot wake up. Sayuki goes on a quest with snow rabbit Toto to find ingredients for a cure.
In the multiplayer game the Snow Goddess Tribe holds a beauty contest which Sayuki and her sister Koyuki enter. Players compete to destroy the most ghosts and collect the most snowballs.
Once bosses have been defeated in the story mode they can be fought in boss attack mode.
The Wii release requires a remote and nunchuk and allows players to fire in any direction. In the PS2 version players can only fire in the direction they are facing. "

Setsuna must leave with her safeguards for the farthest land, where the ceremony of sacrifice will be held.
I am Setsuna introduces the authentic JRPG style of yesteryear! Journey with Setsuna as she prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice and save the people of her land. A powerfully nostalgic experience, blending a classic style of story-telling, battle system and gameplay.

Gameplay and Features

A new battle system inspired by the timeless JRPG classic, Chrono Trigger.
An emotionally impactful and memorable story which immerses players in the narrative of Setsuna, whose story portrays heartrending sorrow.
Beautiful character designs and varied in-game locales evoke nostalgia for classic RPGs.
