Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

Created by renowned designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi of REZ, Sega Rally, and Space Channel 5 fame, this puzzle game delivers a unique gameplay experience that challenges players to bust blocks while grooving to evolving rock, techno, and pop musical scores.Features

A Simple Puzzler: Users are challenged to control a block until it lands on the ground, creating a square using blocks of the same colour. In order to delete the shape from the field, it must be larger than 2 squares by 2 squares. The larger the square you delete, the higher your score.
A Unique Puzzler: Any expanded square regions will be deleted when the Sequencing Bar passes by. A player's success is determined by how far you can expand the square regions in order to delete large boxes at once.
In Sync: Each key action generates sound effects. The flow of the Sequencing bar and the speed of the descending block are synchronized with the beat of the background music. Once a block is deleted, a music file is played. The more blocks destroyed in a sequence, the better the music.
Single Player Modes: Enjoy 24 stages of graphics and music in Challenge Mode, race the clock and beat the odds in Time Attack Mode, earn graphical skins and avatars as you battle CPU characters in Duel Mode and draw shapes with blocks in Puzzle Mode. 
Multi-player Functionality: Through Wireless LAN technology, the user can compete with an opponent in the ""VS."" Mode
Multiple Game Stages: Four stages, each with its own musical theme and sound effects, offer increasing levels of difficulty tied to beats-per-minute.
Changeable Skins: Users can earn graphical skins as they clear various stages throughout the game. Skins can then be changed to the users liking, much like a media player.
Collectible Characters: Players can increase their collection of characters by beating CPU characters and clearing stages. They can show off their Lumines skills by using the characters they've earned as an avatar, giving themselves a unique identity.

The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart.
One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches.
In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre. 
Without a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion. Fate drags you into this bloody conflict and shoves you into a raging civil war, where you help fight for the future of Bohemia.

During the  mission Point Man learned that the man wasn’t working alone. In fact,  the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic,  cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically  powerful mother, Alma Wade—products of Armacham’s perverse paranormal  experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the  standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pair’s homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly  accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its  inhabitants and almost all of Point Man’s squad mates.
For months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear  that Alma’s psychic influence survived—and worse, her paranormal power  is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony  repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her  bloodline and reunite her family. Armacham’s security force remains  violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city,  and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.
With the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots,  where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from  the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point  Man’s side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted,  yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?

On the ground, tackle enemies and complete objectives in whatever order you choose, and navigate your way through a massive, free-roaming environment.

They give people another chance to live.Literally.
There  exists a technology that allows doctors to weave artificial memories,  such that a patient can request attempts to alter their mind, and wake  up with memories of things that didn't actually happen.
However,  since these new memories are permanent, the conflict between them and  the existing authentic memories clash in such a way that it ceases the  person's ability to properly function.
Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to  fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives. . . but didn't.
The  technology requires the doctors to step into the memories of the  patient, which are reconstructed as interactive scenes. The doctors then  gradually traverse backwards through memories of the patient's life  until they reach childhood -- at which point, the wish of the patient in  present time would be transferred over. 
Along with the doctors'  influence, the patient (as a child) could then lead an entire different  life inside their head, working toward and fulfilling their dying wish  themselves.
And if all goes well, they would wake up,  having lived the dream life they never had, and embrace a brief moment  of blissful fulfillment.
Shortly after, they'd draw their last breath.
This  particular story follows Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts' attempt to fulfill  the dream of the dying elderly man, Johnny. In their mission to do so,  they traverse backwards through the man’s memories, unfolding his  curious life story before their eyes.
With each step back in time,  a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. And as the two doctors  piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to  find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it  is. 
And Johnny's last wish is, of course. . . to go to the moon.

An abducted soul, a lifetime of sins, a journey to the depths of despair. Dante’s Inferno™ is a third-person action adventure adaptation of the medieval epic poem The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The dark fiction gave birth to the Tuscan Italian dialect and is widely considered to have defined the western world’s contemporary conception of hell and purgatory. The poem tells the tale of Dante who journeys through the twisted, menacing nine circles of hell in pursuit of his beloved Beatrice.
Written in the 14th Century, The Divine Comedy was published and read aloud in Italian (unlike the Bible), thereby making the poem accessible to the mass public. The poem delivers a striking and allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife and the punishments of hell. In part one, known as Dante’s Inferno, Dante traverses all nine circles of hell; limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery.

Multiplayer Modes
Here is a quick overview of the seven modes of play in Metroid Prime        Hunters, available in both local and online play.
Battle -- Anything goes in Battle Mode, where your goal is to eliminate        your opponents in a timed deathmatch. Rack up more kills than your        competitors to score a victory.
Survival -- In Survival Mode, you begin the game with a limited number        of lives. The goal is simple -- drain your enemies' stock of lives        before your own runs out and be the last hunter standing.
Bounty -- Fight for the possession of an Octolith and be the first        hunter to deliver it to the drop point to succeed in Bounty Mode. This        is pure bounty hunting at its finest.
Defender -- Defender is how bounty hunters play King of the Hill. Secure        the designated area and accumulate points while you are the only hunter        to occupy it.
Prime Hunter -- Gain the coveted enhanced powers of the Prime Hunter,        and see how long you can keep them while the competition tries to end        your reign. Keep Prime Hunter status the longest to win.
Capture -- Your goal in Capture Mode is to raid the enemy team's        territory and steal their precious Octolith. Score when both Octoliths        are safe at your base.
Nodes -- Explore the arena to find Node Rings, and earn points while        they are under your control. The hunter who reaches the point goal first        will win the match.
Adventure Mode
In the single-player Adventure Mode, Samus embarks on a quest to find        powerful relics left behind by an ancient warrior culture. But Samus        isn't the only bounty hunter on this mission. Along the way, she'll have        to fight off the galaxy's most elite hunters who hope to harness the        power for themselves.

 Hone your skills and unlock bounty hunters for use in Multiplayer Mode          by completing the single-player adventure. 
 Explore multiple stages collecting Octoliths, and prevent other bounty          hunters from stealing them along the way. 
 Engage in brutal boss battles at the conclusion of each stage. 
 Classic Metroid puzzle-solving is mixed with intense shooting action          for an all-new Metroid experience. 

 
The Hunters
Each of the seven bounty hunters in Metroid Prime Hunters has a unique        alternate form and special weapon. Which hunter will be your favorite?
Samus -- Samus Aran is well-known throughout the galaxy as an efficient        and experienced bounty hunter. Few other hunters can compete with        Samus's long history of successful missions, most of which were carried        out against seemingly insurmountable odds.
Trace -- Trace is a Kriken, one of the most hated and feared races in        the galaxy. Every Kriken, when he reaches a certain age, is exiled by        its clan for a rite of passage. Trace is currently in exile, traveling        the galaxy looking for planets to expand the Kriken empire.
Noxus -- Noxus is a member of the Vhozon, a proud and reclusive race        that inhabit the outer rim of the galaxy. A spiritual being who walks a        harsh, righteous path, Noxus has become a Bounty Hunter to administer        justice to the galaxy’s criminals and evildoers.
Spire -- Spire is thought to be the sole remaining Diamont, an ancient        race of silicon-based lifeforms whose bodies are composed of organic        rock. Spire travels the galaxy as a bounty hunter searching for        information on the location, or fate, of the rest of his people.
Sylux -- Little is known about the mysterious bounty hunter known as        Sylux, other than the fact that Sylux harbors an intense hatred for the        Galactic Federation and the bounty hunter who has helped the Federation        time and time again -- Samus Aran.
Weavel -- Once a powerful Space Pirate General, Weavel was critically        wounded during an altercation between the Space Pirates and Samus Aran.        With just his brain and spinal cord still functional, his body was fused        with a mobile life support system.
Kanden -- A lab experiment gone awry, Kanden was created to be the        ultimate soldier. However, stress from the neural combat encoding        sequences was more than Kanden’s still-mortal brain could handle, and        left him ferocious, deadly and dangerously unpredictable.

The Nintendo DS version of LEGO Star Wars II stands as a completely unique version of the game. Using the system's power for full 3D action, it also creatively utilizes the touch screen.

Use the touch screen to do the following:

Swap between characters on the fly.
Take full hands-on advantage of the Character Customizer.
Swap between all unlocked Characters in Free Play mode.
Control the camera.


Wireless connectivity also allows for two-player co-op and an exclusive four-player versus mode, the Battle Arena. Collect 10 mini-kit pieces in each level to put together bounty hunters to fight in this environment set at Jabba's Palace. Compete to be the first to find and capture Han Solo in carbonite. The Battle Arena mode features single-pack downloadable play for up to four users.
Use the Character Customizer for Story mode by adding traditional LEGO accessories such as cowboy hats to the likes of Luke, Han and Leia. Like in the console versions, you can create even wackier custom-made characters for play in Free Play mode.

You decide the role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge for humanity. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.
 
A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It’s up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race.
 
Key Features:
 

Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character.  
Groundbreaking Kinesthetics - Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do.
Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You’ll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.

Virtual Texturing – Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics,. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology. "

Based on the original trilogy, Lego Indiana Jones follows the tried and tested formula of the Lego Star Wars games, putting players into miniature versions of the famous characters from the series (Indy, Marion and many more) and letting them run riot in expansive and beautifully crafted levels based on key locations from the films.
Using your characters special abilities (such as Indy's famous whip) you have to guide your characters through the levels, picking up the mountain of collectable items and 'studs' (currency in the Lego games) and unlocking characters and extras to access even more areas. Over thw 18 levels (plus bonus levels) you will have so much fun, especially if you love Lego (and of course the movies).

After the last Ice Age, the glaciers retreated to leave behind a land blooming with nature and resources where humans and animals alike can thrive – provided they have what it takes to prove their dominance. 
• Discover the majestic and savage land of Oros with its breathtaking valley of redwood forests, harsh taiga, and humid swamps where you can see Earth as it was before man laid claim to it. 
• Oros teems with life from large herds of deer and vicious packs of dire-wolves to warring enemy tribes. It is ruled by megafauna such as sabretooth tigers and woolly mammoths, giant animals that dominated the Earth in the Stone Age and were feared by every other living being.

Empire Earth is a real-time strategy game that spans about a half a million years of human history, the last 200 of which take place 200 years from now. So if you're the type who appreciates ambitious game designs, then you've found one in Stainless Steel Studios' first game, which was conceived by the designer of the original Age of Empires. 

Actually, Empire Earth has a great deal in common with Ensemble Studios' highly successful Age of Empires series. Even the games' graphics look similar, though Empire Earth uses a fully 3D engine, unlike Age of Empires. Similarities aside, Empire Earth is a huge game to say the least--it's much more time-consuming and involved than the typical real-time strategy game, and its staggering variety of units is as impressive as it is intimidating. 

Real-time strategy is sometimes criticized for favoring shallow, action-oriented gameplay rather than strategic depth--but that's definitely not the case here. In fact, Empire Earth is best reserved for hard-core real-time strategy players who won't mind the game's less-than-stellar graphics and sound but will instead relish the ability to relive 14 different epochs of human warfare.

The award-winning next-gen killer app returns with Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter™ 2.  The Ghosts are back!
It’s 2014, and the soldier of the future returns to encounter a new and more imminent threat along the recently completed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Ghosts are more powerful with an upgraded Integrated Warfighter System (IWS) but will have only 72 hours to assess the threat and stop the rebels from reaching U.S. soil. 
With a border that's 1,900 miles long and an enemy that doesn’t play by the rules, this is a job for the U.S. military’s most elite fighting unit. This is a job for the Ghosts. 




Groundbreaking visual experience: The original Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter set the visual standard for next-gen consoles, and Advanced Warfighter 2 takes that achievement to a whole new level. The war zone comes to life as you navigate through trash-strewn streets and pick off enemies from behind bomb-scarred structures. The cutting-edge physics and particle systems show some of the most intense and realistic explosions, smoke, and environment destruction ever seen in a video game. Dynamic lighting and shadows morph as real-time day/night cycles and a constantly changing weather system require you to adjust to the changing conditions on the fly.
All-new battlegrounds: The Ghosts defend U.S. soil from a cross-border attack, taking the fight to new locations. The Ghosts battle enemies in mountain terrains, barren deserts, and even on their home turf in El Paso, Texas. Each environment presents its own benefits and challenges and calls for fresh tactical approaches.
Vastly improved A.I.: A.I. is more challenging than ever. Watch your back as rebels send their own team members to flank your position or gain vantage points by utilizing vertical gameplay to pick you off from the rooftops above. Don't worry—your team’s got your back. Improved squad-mate A.I. now feeds you more of the information you need with descriptive commands like, ""Enemy spotted behind red truck ahead.""
Upgraded Cross-Com: The revolutionary Cross-Com feature has been upgraded for Advanced Warfighter 2. The new Cross-Com 2.0 gives you more information than ever before. Not only will you be able to see what your friendly forces see in the top left display, but the click of a button will expand that to full-screen view for a clearer and more precise picture, providing a comprehensive view of the entire battlefield. The new Full Command View allows unprecedented precision in developing and issuing tactical plans on the battlefield.
Expanded combat support: Command lethal air strikes with jet fighters, gain mobile cover for otherwise impassable situations, and replenish armaments on the battlefield using an unmanned artillery MULE. Immediately heal the entire team, including the squad leader Scott Mitchell, with a new medic class of soldier.
Multiplayer action: The game that dominated Xbox LIVE online multiplayer is back and it's bigger and better than ever before!

The United States has a military presence in two thirds of countries around the world.
A group of 12 have had enough and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Sam Fisher is the leader of the newly formed 4th Echelon unit: a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Sam and his team must hunt down these terrorists by any means necessary, and stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero.
Operate Without Restrictions
Sam is back and deadlier than ever. He's the only secret operative with the power to act above the law, and uses ruthless methods to interrogate enemies in order to extract crucial information that will prevent the next Blacklist attack. Pursuing the terrorists to the far reaches of the world, Sam flies from exotic locales to US cities as he races against the clock to find out who’s behind the Blacklist. Thrilling gameplay is enhanced by full motion performance capture, creating a highly cinematic experience.                    
Unleash the Power of Fourth Echelon Prototypes
Infiltrate terrorist cells by using new gadgets such as the upgraded snake cam and micro tri-rotor drone which allows Sam to scout ahead, mark targets remotely, distract enemies, or explode with frag grenade force. Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is also bringing back fan-favorites like the sticky shocker, and for close quarters combat, players can wield the curved and brutal Karambit knife.
Build a New Echelon
With a mandate directly from the president, Sam is building a whole new Echelon unit; his team, his way. Anna “Grim” Grimsdottir is his technical operations manager, CIA operative Isaac Briggs brings additional firepower, and resident hacker Charlie Cole rounds out his support crew. Fourth Echelon is a fully mobile ops unit with unlimited resources and cutting-edge technology aboard the repurposed stealth airliner, the Paladin.
Enjoy a Fully Integrated Experience
Sam and his team are aware of terrorist attacks in real time thanks to the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI). The SMI allows the team to receive data about mission objectives while on the move. Players can earn money for completing missions and objectives and buy upgraded weapons and items from the SMI hub aboard the Paladin.

5 different game modes
The different modes offer a variety of styles of play, and a variety of audio to reflect the mood, pace and events of the various playing styles.
Puzzler Tournament
This is the main game mode, in which the player tries to become as talented as a Puzzle Master. It provides a structure in which the player is compelled to progress through a number of different puzzle types.
The player is challenged by the Puzzler Master with climbing a metaphorical ladder of puzzles. Each successfully completed rung would see the player’s ‘rank’ rise.
When the player completes the final rung of the ladder, the Puzzler Master will judge them to have reached ‘enlightenment’ – the highest rank a Puzzler can reach.
Quick Blast
Quick Blast is the perfect mode for quick games when you have a few minutes to spend for play. Tell the game exactly how much time you have to play, and you will be set a number of challenges especially picked to make the most of the available time.

Fast & Fun
Gamers that like an adrenalin rush with their puzzles will love the Fast & Fun mode.

The aim is to complete as many puzzles as possible in a row without running out of time or making an error.

This Mode is a 2-players challenge. The rules will vary depending on the type of puzzle being played, but players will take it in turns to resolve a section of the puzzle and compete against each other.

The United States has a military presence in two thirds of countries around the world.
A group of 12 have had enough and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Sam Fisher is the leader of the newly formed 4th Echelon unit: a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Sam and his team must hunt down these terrorists by any means necessary, and stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero.
Operate Without Restrictions
Sam is back and deadlier than ever. He's the only secret operative with the power to act above the law, and uses ruthless methods to interrogate enemies in order to extract crucial information that will prevent the next Blacklist attack. Pursuing the terrorists to the far reaches of the world, Sam flies from exotic locales to US cities as he races against the clock to find out who’s behind the Blacklist. Thrilling gameplay is enhanced by full motion performance capture, creating a highly cinematic experience.                    
Unleash the Power of Fourth Echelon Prototypes
Infiltrate terrorist cells by using new gadgets such as the upgraded snake cam and micro tri-rotor drone which allows Sam to scout ahead, mark targets remotely, distract enemies, or explode with frag grenade force. Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is also bringing back fan-favorites like the sticky shocker, and for close quarters combat, players can wield the curved and brutal Karambit knife.
Build a New Echelon
With a mandate directly from the president, Sam is building a whole new Echelon unit; his team, his way. Anna “Grim” Grimsdottir is his technical operations manager, CIA operative Isaac Briggs brings additional firepower, and resident hacker Charlie Cole rounds out his support crew.

Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

The indications are that this latest incarnation will surpass everything that went before it and prove that PES 2008 will be the greatest version of the beautiful game to date. Two new cover stars will grace the packshot with multiple player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and England star Michael Owen endorsing the quality of PES 2008 by deciding to use their considerable talents alongside that of the game. As well as the outside having a new look, fans will be eager to know what new changes can be found inside the most important area of PES 2008 – the gameplay. PES 2008 will feature a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It will learn counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers will hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates will make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built.

In the dark days of the end of World War Two amidst the ruins of Berlin, one bullet can change history…

Sniper Elite V2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the  highly-acclaimed Sniper Elite, giving gamers the most authentic World  War II sniping experience available. You are elite US sniper Karl  Fairburne. Parachuted into Berlin amidst the Germans’ final stand, your  mission is to prevent Nazi V2 rocket program technology from falling  into the hands of the besieging Red Army. You must aid key scientists  keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the  Russians.
Take advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your  targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill,  patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the  key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race  against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite  returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are  rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are  graphically rendered in X-ray as the bullet enters and destroys your  victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact  of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.
As World War II ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts. Use it wisely.

The graphics and gameplay are somewhat similar to the first Zoo Tycoon game, except for the fact that the terrain types do not blend with each other like they do in the PC and Mac versions.
The objects and animals available in the game are also that of the first Zoo Tycoon game, yet it only contains the original animals, because of the inability to download bonus content or upload animals onto a DS. Other features, such as building exhibits as big as you want have also been removed due to the game being handheld.
The game has two playing options, either tutorial/scenario or freeform. Tutorial/Scenario mode takes the player through many short games, each with a set goal. The goals start off by teaching the basics; how to place items, purchase animals, and other needed knowledge of the game. They then progress to goals that have a set time limit and most require a certain happiness from the animals, a certain number of exhibits, etc. Freeform lets players create a zoo free of time restrictions and goals.

Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword (released as Fire Emblem in the US and Europe) is the first Fire Emblem game released outside of Japan. It is the seventh game in the series, and is the prequel to Fire Emblem: Sword of Seals.
Fire Emblem is a turn-based strategy RPG in a western medieval setting, where you use swords, axes, lances, bows, and magic  tomes to launch attacks. One distinctive feature of this series is that once a character dies, they are gone unless you restart a chapter, or start a new play-through.
This game is split into 2 parts. The first is Lyn's story, where you follow Lyn, a Sacaen sword-fighter, as she travels through the land trying to save her grandfather. This part acts as a tutorial for the game and introduces the player to all the game-play elements.
The second part has two stories you can choose from. The first is Eliwood's, the Marquess of Pherae's son, and the second is Hector's, Marquess Ostia's younger brother and good friend of Eliwood. Both stories follow the same overall story, in trying to stop Nergal, but take small sidepaths from one another along the way.

The members of this enigmatic group are the ones who were trapped under the ruins of Midgar for three long years; the Deepground soldiers.
Vincent Valentine finds himself pursued by several elite members of the mysterious Deepground organization. An unrelenting chain of events leads Vincent to the truth behind his past...and forces him once again to be the key player in a battle for the planet itself and all those living in it.
Just what is the connection between Vincent's past and the recent attacks? When the world is engulfed in darkness, his gun will toll a dreadful dirge...

The ""roadie's roadie"", Eddie is the 1st person anyone calls when they need guitars tuned or stages rigged. With a love for hot rods and a photographic memory for every Heavy Metal album cover, and the lyrics those albums contained, committed to memory, Eddie has always felt out of place, like he should have been born earlier, when the music was real.One night a stage accident knocks Eddie unconscious. With his blood dripping into the belt buckle he wears, a gift from his father, his blood quenches an ancient thirst that sucks him into a world that looks very strange yet oddly familiar, a world where every Heavy Metal album cover and lyric Eddie knows has come to life, a world where the evil emperor Doviculus and his demon army, The Tainted Coil, have enslaved the last remaining humans.Led by Lars Halford alongside his sister Lita and the mysterious Ophelia, the human resistance is far from helpless. However, what they lack is someone to bring them all together; someone who can organize them and lead them into battle, what they need is a roadie. Under Eddie's command, this barbaric force of hot-rods, Marshall stacks, leather, and chrome will bring this ancient world into the age of Metal.• Action Combat! – Brütal Legend's core gameplay is classic Action. From close quarter blows delivered by The Separator, Eddie's blood soaked broad axe, to ranged combat from your demon-slaying guitar named Clementine, as well as vehicular attacks supplied by your hot rod, The Deuce (aka The Druid Plow), Brütal Legend delivers deep, rewarding, fun combat that will have you throwing your ""devil horns"" in the air.

Trusted wingmen Peppy, Slippy and Falco are along for the ride  – if one of them is chased or captured by an enemy, players must act to  protect them in order to keep their team strong.
Each mission takes players through a different planet of the  Lylat system as they blast enemies, collect power-ups and fight powerful  bosses on their way to the final battle.
A new multiplayer option lets up to four  players engage in fierce aerial combat via a local wireless connection  (using four systems and one game card via DS Download Play). The  multiplayer mode also includes new power-ups and special weapons.  Players can use the Nintendo 3DS system's inner camera to display a live  video feed of their faces as they battle, bringing a new level of fun  and personalization to the multiplayer experience.

Its purpose was to draw the Winds of  Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the  Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex  falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.
Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet  others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter  purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the  hands of the victor.
The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War:  WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breathtaking new  narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan,  Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to  culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike  any other Total War title to date.
Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the  world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a  series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The  Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each  Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each  race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics,  narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary  characters, and staggering new battlefield bombardment abilities.
Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War:  WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal new combined campaign.  Merging the landmasses of The Old World plus Naggaroth, Lustria, Ulthuan  and the Southlands into a single epic map, players may embark on  monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.

Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai’s case – a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.
 
But winning is only part of the fun in Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing! Each character has a specific All Star move – such as Super Sonic, Banana Blitz and Tails Tornado – that allows a quick way for competitors to get back into the race! Power ups and weapons can also be collected around the tracks and used against the opposition to ensure they don’t become a threat to that number one position.
 
Battle it out in single or multiplayer mode, allowing up to four friends to race in frantic split-screen action, or up to eight players to compete online in the ultimate racing showdown.
 
Can Amigo scramble Eggman? Will AiAi say bye-bye to Tails? Are you gonna be faster than Sonic? The race will start in 2010…

The Yakuza attackers run off, taking Miyu instead.
Scott soon learns that Isao Sato is the Oyabun, the Godfather of one of Tokyo's largest Yakuza families.

Once in Japan, Scott seeks out Otori, a reformed Yakuza and an expert in the art of sword fighting. A friend to Sato and a man of honor and tradition, Otori reluctantly agrees to help. Otori trains Scott in the art of the sword. Meanwhile, another man named Harry Tanner teaches Scott all about the Japanese Underworld.

The ""roadie's roadie"", Eddie is the 1st person anyone calls when they need guitars tuned or stages rigged. With a love for hot rods and a photographic memory for every Heavy Metal album cover, and the lyrics those albums contained, committed to memory, Eddie has always felt out of place, like he should have been born earlier, when the music was real.  One night a stage accident knocks Eddie unconscious. With his blood dripping into the belt buckle he wears, a gift from his father, his blood quenches an ancient thirst that sucks him into a world that looks very strange yet oddly familiar, a world where every Heavy Metal album cover and lyric Eddie knows has come to life, a world where the evil emperor Doviculus and his demon army, The Tainted Coil, have enslaved the last remaining humans.  Led by Lars Halford alongside his sister Lita and the mysterious Ophelia, the human resistance is far from helpless. However, what they lack is someone to bring them all together; someone who can organize them and lead them into battle, what they need is a roadie. Under Eddie's command, this barbaric force of hot-rods, Marshall stacks, leather, and chrome will bring this ancient world into the age of Metal.• Action Combat! – Brütal Legend's core gameplay is classic Action. From close quarter blows delivered by The Separator, Eddie's blood soaked broad axe, to ranged combat from your demon-slaying guitar named Clementine, as well as vehicular attacks supplied by your hot rod, The Deuce (aka The Druid Plow), Brütal Legend delivers deep, rewarding, fun combat that will have you throwing your ""devil horns"" in the air.

This game is the first, chronologically, in the Castlevania series. It reveals very important elements to the story of the Belmonts such as the birth of Dracula, the first Belmont to encounter him, their relationship before becoming enemies, and the creation of the Vampire Killer (a very sad story). I found the music in this game to be remarkable. Brought me back to the old Castlevania days when music helped create atmoshpere. The level designed might not be original but they are very challanging and well designed. The game is quite long itself but also has quite a few side quests to keep you playing beyond the ending. The voice acting and dialogue can often be disapointing. No more than most american voice acting in video games but still hampers the amazing story that is being told. This game has one of the biggest plot twists i've ever encountered while gaming and makes the famous Vampire Killer (the whip the Belmonts are known for) all the more intense.   "

An abducted soul, a lifetime of sins, a journey to the depths of despair. Dante’s Inferno™ is a third-person action adventure adaptation of the medieval epic poem The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The dark fiction gave birth to the Tuscan Italian dialect and is widely considered to have defined the western world’s contemporary conception of hell and purgatory. The poem tells the tale of Dante who journeys through the twisted, menacing nine circles of hell in pursuit of his beloved Beatrice.
Written in the 14th Century, The Divine Comedy was published and read aloud in Italian (unlike the Bible), thereby making the poem accessible to the mass public. The poem delivers a striking and allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife and the punishments of hell. In part one, known as Dante’s Inferno, Dante traverses all nine circles of hell; limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery.

Set your fastest time on  Race Drops, post your highest score in Trick Drops, and descend as far  down the mountain as you can in Survival Drops. Once you’ve set a  personal best, a ghost of your run will be uploaded to the SSX universe.  You can challenge your friends’ ghosts to earn in-game credits, or let  your ghost rake in the credits for you, even while you’re away from your  console. Ongoing competition with friends on your own schedule is the  core experience of Explore Mode.

[ A Massive World ]  From Antarctica to Africa and the Himalayas to the Alps, players can  navigate a Google-Earth inspired globe and drop into nine of the most  iconic mountains ranges and regions on the planet. Using NASA satellite  topographical data and our proprietary Mountain Man development tool,  each of these iconic mountain ranges have been built, then exaggerated,  to deliver a gameplay experience that is true to SSX.  [ SSX Characters ]  Favorite characters, as selected by the fans, make their return to SSX  along with some new faces joining the franchise. Roster includes: Elise,  Mac, Kaori, Psymon, Moby, Zoe, Griff, Ty, Tane, Alex, Eddie, and the  first real-world snowboarder ever to be a playable character in SSX -  Travis Rice.

This...may be our last chance.
Final Fantasy X
The world lies on the brink of destruction. Only a select few may be able to save it. 
In ages past, the world of Spira experienced a golden  age of  perfection, brought about by an advanced civilization through the  use  of wondrous machinery called machina..
However, around one thousand years before the present day, a   colossal menace known only as ""Sin"" appeared and sundered all before it.   Though a line of summoners have since brought Sin low many times, 				 		it inevitably returns in an unending cycle of destruction. In the   face of this ever-pervasive threat, the people of Spira flocked to the   teachings of Yevon, which tell that Sin is a punishment to 						those  who relied overly on machina.
Tidus is a young Blitzball star that mysteriously finds himself  in  Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin one  thousand  years in the past. Believing Sin to be the key to returning  home,  Tidus joins a young summoner named Yuna on her pilgrimage to  destroy  Sin and bring about the Calm.
Final Fantasy X-2
Last time she saved the world. This time its personal!
Two years have passed since Sin was destroyed. Since  her victory  and becoming a high summoner, Yuna has lived on her  childhood home of  Besaid Island. Then one day, Rikku comes to Besaid and  shows Yuna a  sphere. 						The recording is of him. Or is it?
Yuna can't tell whether it's him or just someone who looks like  him.  If it is him, Yuna might be able to see him one more time. No  matter  what the truth may be, the answers she finds may change things  forever.

I don’t want to shank it.” Earning the prestigious title of #1 Golfer of All Time can be a nerve racking process and it’s exactly what gamers will experience in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 as they fight off more than just pressure but also the man who’s trying to claim that title for his own, Tiger Woods.    In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06, gamers will attempt to settle the old debate of just who is the #1 Golfer of All Time. They’ll play golf legends such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan on their terms and in their specific eras (equipment, clothing and all). However, Tiger Woods is also there and is after the same goal. It’s your job to find him, stop him, and ultimately supplant him as the #1 golfer of every era. Duel with Tiger in multiple matches as he becomes your nemesis, chasing and even taunting you in every tournament.    Just as it is on the PGA TOUR®, the key to a good shot is execution and precision. In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 both analog sticks are used to give more control than ever over each shot. The left analog stick will continue to control the backswing and downswing, while the right analog stick, or “Shape stick”, controls ball trajectory and spin. Players are now challenged to focus on the impact point on the ball, while thinking more strategically before executing a shot. This also extends to putting where players will have to rely more on finesse and will need to move the analog stick only as far as needed to make the putt   The game of golf is as much psychological as it is physical and a key for gamers in 2006 will be maintaining confidence. With tension on every shot and mounting pressure to become the best, you can either keep your composure or lose it and become that embarrassing hack on the course. Based on good or bad shots or scores you make, a Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease based on the amount of confidence you possess.Dual Analog Swing and Putting  New advanced swing technique uses both analog sticks to “shape” shots. The left analog stick executes the swing and the right analog stick shapes the shot, controlling ball trajectory and spin. While putting, players will rely on “touch” and finesse as they swing the analog stick only as far as needed to make a putt. A new aiming mechanism also enables the user to line up and gauge putting speed.   Gamebreaker  Based on good or bad shots and scores you make, your Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease. When you hit certain thresholds you’ll earn the opportunity to trigger a Gamebreaker situation, giving you the ability to hit a longer and more accurate shot.   Wagering and Shot Calling  Call your shot before making it and reap the rewards. Players can elect to “call their shot” before making it, putting up a wager that they can pull it off.   Courses  Play a total of 15 courses (11 licensed and three fantasy courses) including the site of the 2005 British Open, St. Andrews Golf Links. Seven new licensed courses include TPC Sawgrass (Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.) Reflection Bay (Las Vegas, Nev.), Cog Hill Golf Club (Chicago, Ill.), Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club (Portland, Ore.), Sahalee Country Club (Seattle, Was.) and Doral Golf Resort (Miami, Fla).   PGA TOUR Players  Compete as or against 15 different PGA TOUR players including Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and new this year Chris DiMarco, Mike Weir, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald. Additionally, 12 new fantasy characters will challenge you on the links   EA SPORTS Online Competition  Play with up to four players across the country on the PlayStation 2 console or Xbox Live. Compete in Online Tournament events complete with money lists, full stat tracking, and league leaders.   Play a Career  In PGA TOUR Season mode for console versions, play along with the 52-week PGA TOUR calendar of events for up to 30 seasons. Obtain sponsorships from real golf equipment manufacturers throughout your career and drive to surpass Tiger Woods as #1 on the overall money list.   GameFace  Players will once again use the industry leading character creation technology GameFace to create their own golfer, outfit and build up their golfer’s attributes to attempt to become the #1 Golfer of All Time. New this year is the ability to choose your own voice for your character.   Reactive Tiger Proofing  The course will literally fight back. Courses will become more difficult as you score well, and will ease up if you play poorly.   Golf’s Best Commentators  David Feherty and Gary McCord make up the golf announcing Dream Team and provide their commentary and irreverent observations on each round.  --EA  "

Put on your shades and prepare  to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic  proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are  invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and  enormous alien bosses can’t stop our hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the  world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.
The King arrives with an arsenal  of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of  interactivity. This game puts the pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in  cheek. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on  whiteboards or ogle the many hot women that occupy Duke’s life - that is if you  can pull yourself away from destroying alien invaders. With hours and hours of  over-the-top single player action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes,  rest assured knowing the fun will last.  Duke Nukem was and will forever be a gaming icon, and this is his legend.


 Ego and Then Some: Step into the  shoes of Duke Nukem, the steroidal One-Man army who never fails and always gets  the Babes.
 Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no  punches. He does and says the things you  are thinking. Duke’s constant stream  of hilarious one-liners  throughout the game will have gamers rolling.
 World Interactivity: Spend as  much time as you want shooting  hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool,  air hockey, and slots.
 Scale and Variety: This game has  it all; packed with explosive FPS  action, outlandish settings, vehicle driving,  and puzzle solving —  gamers will never tire of the endless fun.
 Multiplayer Like No Other: Duke  re-envisions classic modes of play  in his own hilarious and humiliating  way.  Shrink your opponent and  squash him with your foot.  Freeze and  shatter him.  Attach explosives  to his back. Roll a pipe bomb between his  legs, or just frag him  old-fashioned with a rocket.

Yet all that has been averted because a handful of  heroes stood in his path.” – Gandalf the White
The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a  co-op Action RPG that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new  chapter in the War of the Ring. Snowblind Studios is in the unique  position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights  to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a  wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and  never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic  and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.
ACTION MEETS RPG
Intense,  visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character  progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best  loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and  feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with  friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on  all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and  make your own mark on Middle-earth.
CO-OP AT ITS CORE
Build your  own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the  North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon  your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together  or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of  playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The  first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is  desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.
AN UNTOLD STORY
While much  attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the  assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North  turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is  grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not  someone else’s fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through  the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours.  This is your war.

Their bargaining chip is a hijacked airliner currently circling the skies, which happens to contain a senator who's a front-runner in the upcoming American presidential elections. With the help of Roger and a child psychic named Alice, Snake's task is recovering Pythagoras and defeat the mercenary group. In true Metal Gear fashion, this is only the beginning of the tale. The storyline wends its way all over the place throughout the game, pitting multiple factions against each other and introducing new characters at a rapid clip. Some of the players in the story may not be what they seem...even Snake himself. Metal Gear Acid tells its story with still artwork and text, rather than employing the same sort of over-the-top cutscenes and voice that helped make the series famous. Gamplay:The card-combat engine in Metal Gear Acid is thick with depth and complexity, though it will likely take you a while to figure all of it out. The basics are simple enough: You have a store of cards from which you'll build a deck before each mission, and at any given time you'll have a hand of random cards drawn from that deck that represent the actions you can take during the present turn. Some cards are designated solely as move cards, which (obviously) are used to move you a set number of squares around the board. You have to build your deck around your combat style such as Offensive, Stealth, Quick, Heavy, and others. Sometimes you have to fight a boss, and usually your deck is not so effective against him, in those cases you should build a new deck to fight him. "

The ocean is teeming with life. Hundreds of real-life species are there to be discovered, from seahorses to giant whales.

This...may be our last chance.
Final Fantasy X
The world lies on the brink of destruction. Only a select few may be able to save it. 
In ages past, the world of Spira experienced a golden  age of  perfection, brought about by an advanced civilization through the  use  of wondrous machinery called machina..
However, around one thousand years before the present day, a   colossal menace known only as ""Sin"" appeared and sundered all before it.   Though a line of summoners have since brought Sin low many times, 				 		it inevitably returns in an unending cycle of destruction. In the   face of this ever-pervasive threat, the people of Spira flocked to the   teachings of Yevon, which tell that Sin is a punishment to 						those  who relied overly on machina.
Tidus is a young Blitzball star that mysteriously finds himself  in  Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin one  thousand  years in the past. Believing Sin to be the key to returning  home,  Tidus joins a young summoner named Yuna on her pilgrimage to  destroy  Sin and bring about the Calm.
Final Fantasy X-2
Last time she saved the world. This time its personal!
Two years have passed since Sin was destroyed. Since  her victory  and becoming a high summoner, Yuna has lived on her  childhood home of  Besaid Island. Then one day, Rikku comes to Besaid and  shows Yuna a  sphere. 						The recording is of him. Or is it?
Yuna can't tell whether it's him or just someone who looks like  him.  If it is him, Yuna might be able to see him one more time. No  matter  what the truth may be, the answers she finds may change things  forever.

The intelligence of players has seen a marked improvement. For example, players now make more realistic runs into space, often pointing where they would like the ball played. The physical aspect has also been beefed up, with strikers using their sheer presence to turn defenders and likewise, the defenders stepping a yard away to enable them to force players away from goal and not letting them spin into dangerous positions.
PES 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. New gameplay modes have been added and features like the much loved Master League mode also returns, together with a host of new tricks, feints and animations that can be used to bamboozle your opposition.

It's 1968 and the rules have changed. 
After years of combat in Vietnam, Lincoln Clay knows this truth: family isn’t who you’re born with, it’s who you die for. Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, it’s possible to make it to the top of the city's underworld.

He can handle anything anyone throws at him. Swift ocean currents, bottomless pits and hordes of enemies might be daunting for a lesser hero, but not Starfy, Nintendo’s newest platforming sensation.
FEATURES

Starfy has been a hero in Japan for years, and The Legendary Starfy marks his North American debut.
Players must guide Starfy through a variety of lush environments to the end of each stage by swimming, jumping and bouncing – all while defeating comical enemies and big bosses. No two stages are alike. Each one has its own mazes, puzzles and challenges to keep Starfy on his toes.
Starfy’s main ability is the Star Spin, an attack that propels him into his enemies with great force. It also lets him burst through walls and barriers, or power through strong currents. As the adventure continues, Starfy learns new skills, such as the Shooting Star attack, which lets him shoot into the ground like a meteor, and Air Jump, which gives him increased jumping abilities.
One of Starfy’s key powers is his ability to transform into four different, powerful forms. Each one grants him special powers to help him overcome the obstacles he encounters throughout the game: Monstar, a dragon that spits fire; Starpedo, an Arctic seal with acrobatic abilities; Starfright, a spooky specter; and Roostar, a super-squawking chicken that lays sonic eggs.

This epic journey propels Death  across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War,  the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in  Darksiders. Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the  series is primarily a hack ‘n slash adventure. The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.

In the dark days of the end of World War Two amidst the ruins of Berlin, one bullet can change history…

Sniper Elite V2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the  highly-acclaimed Sniper Elite, giving gamers the most authentic World  War II sniping experience available. You are elite US sniper Karl  Fairburne. Parachuted into Berlin amidst the Germans’ final stand, your  mission is to prevent Nazi V2 rocket program technology from falling  into the hands of the besieging Red Army. You must aid key scientists  keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the  Russians.
Take advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your  targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill,  patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the  key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race  against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite  returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are  rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are  graphically rendered in X-ray as the bullet enters and destroys your  victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact  of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.
As World War II ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts. Use it wisely.

She's battled baddies on nearly every Nintendo system, cleaned house in  the Super Smash Bros.  series, and recently blasted off for heroic  adventures on the GameCube (Metroid Prime) and the Game Boy Advance  (Metroid Fusion).  Now, Samus Aran returns to her roots and relives the  story that started it all--revealing for the first time full details of  her meeting with the Metroids.  The plotline will be familiar to  longtime fans of the Metroid series, but the challenges are new, the  power-ups are plentiful (taken from several games in the series), and  the graphics and sound are supercharged.  Plus, if you thought that the  original Metroid had a surprise ending, wait until you get past the  Mother Brain in Metroid: Zero Mission.  A new twist provides a deeper  adventure than ever before.
Sent to Zebes to investigate rumors of a deadly alien species, Samus  meets her match in the form of the mysterious Metroids--energy-sapping  creatures that emerge from an oversized cerebrum beneath the planet's  surface.  Samus isn't the only traveler searching for the Metroids.  A  band of space pirates has touched down to extract the curious creatures  and use them as weapons.  Samus must thwart the pirates, but they are  wily and will prove to be more trouble than Samus expects.
In the long-standing Metroid tradition, Zero Mission is a scavenger hunt  for dozens of items--missiles, energy tanks, and tools--that give you  the ability to explore wider and deeper.  Every time you uncover a  device, you'll remember former dead ends that you can finally overcome.   The endless chain of breakthroughs and discoveries causes the world to  continue to grow and form.
The Metroids are only one of the many menacing species that lurk below  the surface.  The Zebesian underground overflows with creatures that aim  to keep you from invading their turf.  Metroid classics Kraid and  Ridley hold fort in dark corners, towering over the comparatively small  bounty hunter.  The planet holds plenty of new threats, too, such as the  lava-dwelling serpent that acts as the first line of defense in Kraid's  lair and the armored larvae that lurk in the deepest sections of  Norfair.  The Space Pirates are no pushovers either, and you won't  always have the Power Suit to protect you.
Samus Aran's next adventure is a nonstop action masterpiece that puts a  new light on the heroine's first visit to Zebes.  It recalls the past  and moves into the future with one giant leap.  Start your thumb  exercises--you'll need to be strong to survive this fast and  free-flowing adventure.
Features:

Samus Aran arrives on Zebes in an adventure that greatly  expands on the legendary NES Metroid title. 
Upgrade Samus's suit with classic power-ups from previous Metroid  titles, plus all-new abilities like the Power Grip, Zip Line, and more. 
Cool cut-scenes bring Samus's incredible story to life like never  before. 
Beautiful graphics and an eerie soundtrack give each environment a  unique, distinctly Metroid feel.

Put on your shades and prepare  to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic  proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are  invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and  enormous alien bosses can’t stop our hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the  world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.
The King arrives with an arsenal  of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of  interactivity. This game puts the pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in  cheek. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on  whiteboards or ogle the many hot women that occupy Duke’s life - that is if you  can pull yourself away from destroying alien invaders. With hours and hours of  over-the-top single player action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes,  rest assured knowing the fun will last.  Duke Nukem was and will forever be a gaming icon, and this is his legend.
 

 Ego and Then Some: Step into the  shoes of Duke Nukem, the steroidal One-Man army who never fails and always gets  the Babes.
 Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no  punches. He does and says the things you  are thinking. Duke’s constant stream  of hilarious one-liners  throughout the game will have gamers rolling.
 World Interactivity: Spend as  much time as you want shooting  hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool,  air hockey, and slots.
 Scale and Variety: This game has  it all; packed with explosive FPS  action, outlandish settings, vehicle driving,  and puzzle solving —  gamers will never tire of the endless fun.
 Multiplayer Like No Other: Duke  re-envisions classic modes of play  in his own hilarious and humiliating  way.  Shrink your opponent and  squash him with your foot.  Freeze and  shatter him.  Attach explosives  to his back. Roll a pipe bomb between his  legs, or just frag him  old-fashioned with a rocket.

Yet all that has been averted because a handful of  heroes stood in his path.” – Gandalf the White
The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a  co-op Action RPG that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new  chapter in the War of the Ring. Snowblind Studios is in the unique  position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights  to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a  wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and  never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic  and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.
ACTION MEETS RPG
Intense,  visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character  progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best  loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and  feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with  friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on  all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and  make your own mark on Middle-earth.
CO-OP AT ITS CORE
Build your  own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the  North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon  your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together  or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of  playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The  first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is  desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.
AN UNTOLD STORY
While much  attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the  assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North  turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is  grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not  someone else’s fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through  the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours.  This is your war.

This heritage  has been celebrated in PES 2016’s new tagline ‘Love The Past, Play The Future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core PES values in last  year’s PES 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
PES 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘Best  Sports Game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘The Beautiful Game’. The series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present PES 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘The Pitch is Ours’ mantra. From  further integration of the industry leading Fox Engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of Master League, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
Fresh Gameplay – Exciting advancements reaffirming the PES series as having the No.1 gameplay.

Advanced Collision System – The physicality of the modern game has been realised in PES 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
Aerial Strength – With the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 Control – In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
Perfect Defence – Performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
Intelligent Player AI – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
Goal Keeper ID – In a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and  Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
Celebration Control – New for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

Fundamental Changes – New significant improvements across key modes and features.

New Master League – The famous and hugely popular  Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
New Visuals – Incorporating the many advancements  of the Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
Dynamic Weather – For the first time in the PES  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes  including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
Human Motion – Seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
New Ball Physics – The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

Quality Improvements – Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myClub – Since the launch of the mode in PES  2015, myClub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for PES 2016.  The enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. Use GP acquired through matches or myClub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. Choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. Build Your  Team, Create Your legacy!
Dynamic Wide Camera Angle – The new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to Intelligent Player AI. Depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
Commentary – New commentators have been  introduced for both UK and Germany, with Peter Drury and Marco Hagemann  joining the PES team. An abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for Master League, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
PS4 Image Importing – Edit mode is synonymous  with the PES series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. PS4 (and PS3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

PES 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the UEFA Champions League club competition, which was announced  recently. This new 3 year partnership allows KONAMI to feature both the  UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the UEFA Super Cup  featured within the iconic Master League mode.

The Legend continues on Nintendo GameCube in an all-new epic adventure  for one to four players. Fusing cooperative and competitive action, Four  Swords Adventures features a unique gameplay system that incorporates  both the television and the Game Boy Advance.
When you enter a building or dive into a cave, your character switches  from the TV to the Game Boy Advance. When you emerge, the frantic action  shifts back to the big screen. To thwart Vaati's nefarious forces,  you'll have to master new skills and techniques never before seen in the  Legend of Zelda series.
Long ago, a valiant hero defeated an evil wind demon known as Vaati and  imprisoned him with a magical seal. Over the ages, the seal weakened.  Now, Vaati has escaped and abducted Princess Zelda and the six Shrine  Maidens. To thwart Vaati's vile forces, legendary hero Link turns to the  mystical power of the Four Sword to split himself into four colored  copies of himself. The four Links embark on a quest to collect Force  Gems and save Princess Zelda. Their journey will take them through  enemy-infested lands and puzzle-plagued dungeons.
One of the most intriguing aspects of Four Swords Adventures is that it  seamlessly fuses many elements from past Zelda games into an all-new  adventure. Zelda veterans will recognize items, characters and enemies  from Zelda classics like Link's Awakening, A Link to the Past, The Wind  Waker and more. This game really is a dream come true for any Zelda fan.
The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures is a massive Zelda  masterpiece that's just as fun for a single player as it is for four  adventurers. The Legend continues on June 7, 2004!
 
Features

Up to four players can link their GBAs to the Nintendo GameCube to  join a fun and frantic competition for Force Gems and special items  while cooperating to move massive blocks, trigger switches, and slay  mighty bosses.

A rich single-player mode allows you to assume control of all four  Links and command their every move by seamlessly switching between  battle formations.

“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""

“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""
