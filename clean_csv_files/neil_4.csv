This epic journey propels Death  across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War,  the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in  Darksiders. Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the  series is primarily a hack ‘n slash adventure. The game takes place  across netherworld environments, including ""The White city,"" an outpost  where angels live, and ""The Eternal Throne,"" a floating fortress where  the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed.  Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical  abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more  nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In  combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide  range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the  game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be  acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and  powerful mount, Despair.

More than 1,000 improvements and enhancements make Sports Interactive and SEGA’s tenth Football Manager the most compelling and realistic to date!
Football Manager 2014 is the most feature-packed and technically advanced release in the series’ history. Benefitting from more than 1,000 improvements and enhancements over its most recent predecessor, FM 2014 is the most realistic simulation of football management ever released.
In addition to enhanced gameplay, FM 2014 also delivers a range of technical innovations, with the game available on Linux for the first time and the introduction of ‘cloud save’ technology, which means that managers can now pursue a single career from any computer, anywhere in the world.
The FM experience is also more customisable than ever before, as the integration of Steam Workshop tools make it easy for managers to create and share customised FM content and experiences such as photo/logo packs, new and custom competitions and even tailor-made in-game challenges using the new Challenge Editor which has been incorporated into the free-to-download Pre-game Editor.
Features

Play      it whenever, wherever, however

Play  on Linux for the first time, plus the inclusion of ‘cloud-save’  technology which means that managers can now pursue a single career from  any computer, anywhere in the world. FM14 also includes integration  with Steam Workshop making it easy for managers to create and share  customised FM content such as photo/logo packs, new and custom  competitions and tailor-made challenges using the new Challenge Editor.

Improved      Match Engine

The 3D Match Engine has seen extensive improvements, including enhanced AI, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations which combine to make this the best looking and fastest FM Match Engine yet.

Tactical      overhaul

There has been a complete redesign of how tactics are created, selected and implemented with player roles and team strategies becoming even more prominent, definable roles for players for multiple positions, new player roles and instructions and improvements to rival managers' AI so that they’ll adapt their tactics more readily over time.

More      realistic transfers and contracts

FM 2014 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. In addition, a number of new ‘real world’ transfer clauses have been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club he’s just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. On top of this, the old ‘turn-based’ system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new ‘live’ system, similar to that used in FM’s contract negotiations.

More      sophisticated board interaction

Contract negotiations are more realistic in FM 2014, as managers and boards can now make demands and lay down their respective visions for the club in both initial job interviews and contract renewal discussions. Managers can also attempt to renegotiate transfer and wage budgets as a reward for staying loyal if they’ve been offered a job by another club, with the outcome helping aid their decision on whether to move or not.

Improved interaction with      players, staff and media

There is now better interaction between players, managers, their rivals and the media; for example, members of the coaching staff now offer feedback on how reserve and youth team players are performing. Managers can also ask key players to have a word with unhappy squad members, while the introduction of an end-of-season meeting allows the manager to let the squad know how they have performed and set targets for the coming season.

News      system

The news system has been overhauled so managers can now deal with many club matters directly from their inbox. In addition, news is now colour-coded, based on category, and contains more detail – for example, scout reports now appear as a single news item with a top-line report on all players scouted and the facility to shortlist or make an offer for each of these players.

Enhanced      user interface

Major changes have been made to FM 2014’s user interface. Key areas have been redesigned – including the training overview page, the transfer centre and the news homepage – while widespread changes have been made across the game’s user interface. The language employed throughout the game has also enjoyed a major overhaul and now corresponds more closely to the language of real world football.

Football      Manager Classic evolved

Managers can now choose more than three playable nations in Classic mode for a more immersive experience. In addition, FM’s ‘fast play’ mode now includes Transfer Deadline Day, a Match Plan wizard and new unlockables.

Five years later, Darius Mason, grandson of Martian Revolution heroes Alec Mason and Samanya,  runs a lucrative business from Bastion, underground hub of Colonist  activity.

MadWorld revolves around the themes of brutality and exhilaration. To give MadWorld the graphical edge to match its brutal theme, we tried removing all color from the world except for blood. As a result, we decided the best way to convey blood, and thus brutality, was against this black and white backdrop. Knowing that there are no other action games with this sort of avant-garde graphical style, our course was set.
By adding touches from American comics, like the exclamations that appear during action scenes, anyone who knows how it feels to read a comic book (or watch an episode of Tom & Jerry) should instantly be able to enjoy playing MadWorld. We are also taking the simple controls of the Wii and adding a variety of actions to the gameplay mix.
Often times, brutality is expressed in a spiteful nature. There are already plenty of games out there that hit this mark; however, we decided that MADWORLD’s brutality should be aimed at providing the user with a sense of exhilaration during play.  To give you an example from gameplay, we have a scene where you can pull a street sign from the ground and shove it into a enemy’s head. However, I thought that it is much more fun to stab someone with a sign that actually has some sort of meaning as opposed to a knife. We tried the idea out, and the reaction amongst the team was so positive, I knew this was the way to proceed.  While one type of action is already fun, one of MadWorld’s most innovative points is the ability to link and layer these actions together. For instance, you can grab that enemy with the street sign through his head and throw him against a spiked wall.

Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As  Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in  exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out  targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of  approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to  you.
HITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The  experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued  with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the  Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode  5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived  on October 31st.
HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of  Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge  Packs and Contracts Mode.
An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that  we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that  are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time  in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they  escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that  you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an  Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never  return.
Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was  created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players.  You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to  complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements.  This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and  mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.
Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark  your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your  friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the  Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever  you load up the game.

The Kremlings have a mysterious new leader named KAOS and are up to their usual mischief, even capturing Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. Now it's up to Dixie Kong and the newest Kong, a giant infant named Kiddy, to rescue the two missing apes. They'll travel across previously unseen parts of the island in their search, and even take to the skies in a rocket at one point.
Lucky for them, Dixie and Kiddy's powers complement each other (including Kiddy's talent for rolling like a barrel), so they form a powerful team capable of major Kremling damage. They're not completely on their own, either, since returning favorites like Funky Kong and Enguarde the swordfish provide help along the way.
And in a series known for its abundance of secrets and high replay value, this entry doesn't disappoint, with enough hours of game play to satisfy Donkey Kong himself. Anyone else have a sudden urge for some bananas?

Discover a unique role-playing game with sophisticated art techniques and gameplay structure. The UNLIMITED Saga story is uniquely told through the eyes of several adventurers. “The Seven Wonders” is a group of ancient structures shrouded in mystery. Legend has it that the powers of long-absent gods lie within, and their release will trigger a rebirth of the Golden Age. The Seven Wonders are scattered across parched deserts, frigid tundra, harsh mountains, and raging seas – all remnants of a time when evil forces ran amok. Some believe the legend, while others dismiss it as a fairy tale – but adventurers strive to conquer the Seven Wonders, and discover their long-entombed secrets. Director Akitoshi Kawazu applies new technologies to create a game that is not only revolutionary, but also unique in presentation. While the game uses a sophisticated game system, it has opted for traditional techniques for its artwork. All of the graphics are hand-drawn and hand-painted, supported by a completely new method of computer-generated graphics called “Sketch Motion”. The new graphics bring forth detailed 2D animation, surpassing the limits of 3D polygons. The battle system has also been revamped into what is known as the “REEL” battle system, a slot machine-like interface allowing players to add new variations to familiar combos and skill development. Groundbreaking features like these result in another milestone title for Akitoshi Kawazu.

The Pokémon Dash Grand Prix is taking place across the Pokémon Islands, and there’s one yellow Pokémon determined to take the top prize!  In Pokémon Dash, you use the Touch Screen to propel your Pokémon toward the finish line. Simply use the stylus to rub the screen in the direction you want Pikachu to move. When you rub the screen more frantically, Pikachu will tear across the level with that much more zip. The race takes place from an overhead viewpoint, with a series of circuits that run across forests and dunes. You’ll need to master these tracks and find the winning edge against crafty rival Pokémon. The races are made up of various different checkpoints. You’ll follow the Dash Radar on the top screen in order to send Pikachu to victory on the bottom screen. With a range of environments that affect your progress, such as Swamp, Icy and Sandy areas, you’ll need to watch your step. Sand slows you down, while ice tends to be slippery. You’ll race in five different Cups, each with five different courses. You can also gain entry to a host of brand new tracks in the shape of Pokémon you’ve collected in your Game Boy Advance Pokémon games! Just place either the Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire or Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen Game Paks into the GBA slot on the DS, and the data stored on those Paks allows you to create a brand new Cup where you can hone your Dash to devastating effect. With a multiplayer mode that lets up to six players race wirelessly, Pokémon Dash is a blast - whether you’re playing chums or just racing against in-game opponents!

Famed game developer Rare Ltd. is reviving one of its most beloved and successful franchises exclusively on Xbox 360® with the third installment of the Banjo-Kazooie series. Banjo-Kazooie™: Nuts & Bolts embraces new and old fans alike, as the famous bear and bird duo return in stunning high definition for a unique adventure of epic proportions. The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest’s challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG’s challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. 
Throughout your adventure, create your own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water, and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. Use your imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle you choose. LOG's challenges have one goal, but your choice of vehicle and tactics will determine how you get there. By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, you will be rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in your quest to defeat Grunty once and for all.
With the power of Xbox 360® and Xbox LIVE®, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts brings an entirely new experience to the console and takes the franchise to a whole new level of enjoyment. High-definition graphics, user-created content, and online gameplay are just three of the many advances people of all ages and skill levels will discover as they embark on their adventure.




Adventure and imagination: If you can imagine it, you can build it in the Mumbo's Motors easy-to-use workshop. Then put your creation to the test as you take on Grunty in your quest for Spiral Mountain. Unlike other games, where you progressively pick up new skills or abilities at points pre-determined by the game’s creator, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts puts the power of improving Banjo's abilities into your hands as you build vehicles that allow Banjo to progress through the game. Vehicle parts include a wide variety of body panels, engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel, and weapons, plus many more weird and wonderful gadgets such as floaters, Mumbo Bombos, and the versatile sticky ball, from which you can design and create anything from a simple object-carrying truck to a space-age flying saucer. Once you've designed your creation, give it the finishing touch by painting it and choosing a suitable name before Banjo jumps in and pilots it into action.
Customizable experience: With more than 100 contraption parts and unlimited combinations possible, no two players will have the same experience in Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts. By exploring the vast game worlds, discovering hidden secrets, and solving puzzles to win rewards, you will continually find more and more ways to customize and improve your contraptions, creating an unprecedented level of user-generated content for a 3-D platform adventure game.
Fun right out of the box: Don't worry if you aren’t the world’s greatest inventor or want to skip the workshop and get straight to the action, because Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts comes with a fully loaded experience right out of the box. Pre-built vehicles are included so you can jump right in and get started, with many more contraptions available for purchase throughout the adventure using the in-game currency system of musical notes.
Engaging storyline and entertaining characters: Two of Rare's most beloved characters return from retirement, making their debut on Xbox 360. To win the deed to their homeland and prevent the evil witch Gruntilda from developing it into tower blocks and malls, Banjo and his best friend Kazooie battle over land, sea, and air against their longtime rival. Familiar faces such as Mumbo Jumbo, Bottles, Captain Blubber, and the Jinjos are also back to lend a hand, along with an equally colorful cast of new friends and foes. Look out for Trophy Thomas, Piddles, Lord of the Games, and Grunty's mechanically menacing army of Gruntbots.
Enjoy alone or with friends: Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts offers complete single-player and multiplayer experiences. Play through the adventure alone in the single-player campaign, or play with friends in competitive or cooperative challenges on your own or in teams.
Fun for everyone: Xbox 360 is the home to the best entertainment experiences for everyone. With Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, Xbox 360 continues to build its impressive lineup of content that appeals to people of all ages and types.

Put on your shades and prepare  to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic  proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are  invading and only Duke can save the world. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and  enormous alien bosses can’t stop our hero from accomplishing his goal: to save the  world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.
The King arrives with an arsenal  of over-the-top weapons, non-stop action, and unprecedented levels of  interactivity. This game puts the pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in  cheek. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on  whiteboards or ogle the many hot women that occupy Duke’s life - that is if you  can pull yourself away from destroying alien invaders. With hours and hours of  over-the-top single player action, and a range of bodacious multiplayer modes,  rest assured knowing the fun will last.  Duke Nukem was and will forever be a gaming icon, and this is his legend.
 

 Ego and Then Some: Step into the  shoes of Duke Nukem, the steroidal One-Man army who never fails and always gets  the Babes.
 Bust a Gut: Duke pulls no  punches. He does and says the things you  are thinking. Duke’s constant stream  of hilarious one-liners  throughout the game will have gamers rolling.
 World Interactivity: Spend as  much time as you want shooting  hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool,  air hockey, and slots.
 Scale and Variety: This game has  it all; packed with explosive FPS  action, outlandish settings, vehicle driving,  and puzzle solving —  gamers will never tire of the endless fun.
 Multiplayer Like No Other: Duke  re-envisions classic modes of play  in his own hilarious and humiliating  way.  Shrink your opponent and  squash him with your foot.  Freeze and  shatter him.  Attach explosives  to his back. Roll a pipe bomb between his  legs, or just frag him  old-fashioned with a rocket.

Millenia ago, a fierce battle was waged for control of an idyllic world known as Pureland.  After much fighting, the brave warriors of Pureland were protectively sealed in their own dimension, away from the rest of the universe.  This was done by means of Talon, a powerful space craft capable of traveling through both time and space.
Centuries have passed and the would-be Masters of Pureland have managed to create a rift in the galaxy, sending the Pureland Water Entity to devour all that stands in its path.
You must journey through past, present, and future to find the 13 pieces of the now-divided Talon.  Only then can you save the universe from total destruction.

Equip your warriors with weapons, armor, and magic to do battle with monsters.
Select from a menu of options that let you change talents or equipment, weave magic potions, and even save the game.
Travel through the past, present, and future as you race against time to assemble Talon, the most powerful space craft ever created.

A new military training program, dubbed A.I.D.A., has evolved to the point where it poses a threat to humanity. The world's top scientists are at a loss as to how it can be contained, and it seems that only a team of elite hackers hold the key to solving the problem. By entering the mind of A.I.D.A. via neurodigital interface, you, as one of the hackers, must use virtual weapons to combat the virtual enemies that wait beyond. However all threat to your life is real!
Thanks to the virtual reality theme, there is no limit to the imagination fuelling the ideas behind it. All the levels you explore are randomly generated, meaning you will always need to be prepared for what lies around the next corner. All the enemies faced take on surprising, often terrifying forms - your weapons to combat them are equally magnificent.
Your character's abilities are enhanced throughout the various missions by picking up system files. For example, weapons are listed as .wpn, Defensive items as .dfn.
The solo mission promises many original scenarios and plot twists to keep you entertained. But we're sure you'll want to try the multiplayer modes playable via PSP wireless network. Up to four players can take part, bringing any tools and weapons collected from the one-player missions to the party.
Everything has been designed with the PSP in mind, from the intuitive controls mapped onto the analog stick and buttons to the navigation screens suited to a smaller screen.
Coded Arms is a gripping experience you won't want to miss, a ground-breaking one-of-a kind for PSP.

The western shore along the Sea of Swords contains a multitude of ecologies and terrains including mountains, forests, swamps, marshes, plains, cities, and ruins. Collectively called the Sword Coast, it attracts adventurers and evil alike, and is the backdrop for this epic adventure.The region encompassed by this game is roughly bordered to the South by the Cloud Peaks, the East by the Wood of Sharp Teeth, the West by the Sea of Swords, and the North by Baldur's Gate (the largest and most affluent city in the region).Chaos threatens to overwhelm the Sword Coast. The state of Amn is under siege to the south, the High Moor is being overrun in the north, and the region around Baldur's Gate is in turmoil. In an area known for its ample resources, a crippling shortage is slowly developing for the metal that is used throughout the Realms for everything from swords to forks - iron. When iron ore reaching the region is smelted, the resulting wares are plagued with brittleness such that they crack and break with little more than normal use. What's worse, trading caravans coming from all directions into Baldur's Gate are under constant attack from bandits and cutthroats who loot not for gold and gems (although they often take those too...), but for iron. The armed factions in Baldur's Gate can scarcely keep themselves armed and the commoners are suffering all the more. Without iron they cannot mend their tools or purchase plows - and everyone knows that if they cannot farm or craft, they will starve come winter.Some blame Amn for the chaos, others the trading cartels, and still others suspect even the Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Yet, this contagion may be an early omen of some greater evil...The player starts the game with one character. This character can be generated using any of the races, classes, and alignments allowed by ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS®. Up to five other adventurers may join the central character as the epic quest proceeds. The player begins in the glorious castle of Candlekeep, an orphan seeking self-knowledge.Although once a stolid coastal fortress, Candlekeep is now a great library filled with endless dusty tomes and crusty sages.

A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It’s up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race.

Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer.

Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You’ll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.

Virtual Texturing – Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics,.

The long awaited Home Run Derby leads the deep features list in MLB 10 The Show for PS3.  Fully implemented in the season modes and available as a stand alone feature, Home Run Derby follows the current MLB rules and flow.  The MLB All-Star Futures Game will also be available within season modes in its correct timeframe (just before the Home Run Derby), as well as fully functional online leagues.
Additional new features for the PS3 game include “Catcher Mode,” the ability to call the game as the catcher, select pitches, and be the ultimate field general, just like Joe Mauer.  MLB 10 The Show will also offer daytime transitional lighting, a newly added “Movie Maker” menu giving the user the ability to select multiple replays to add to and edit a single movie, and 11 new stadiums.  Five new Minor League stadiums will be introduced, as well as a selection of classic parks available on the PS3 for the first time including Forbes Field, Crosley Field, The Polo Grounds, Shibe Park, Sportsman Park, and Griffith Stadium.
Online multiplayer has vastly improved this year to bring more of that competitive fire out amongst friends.   First and foremost, the game will detect and respond better to adverse network conditions and bandwidth has been reduced to help the speed and flow of online gameplay.  Along with the core online league play, where gamers can customize leagues including choosing players, teams, and length of schedule, MLB 10 The Show will now offer fully functional online season leagues!  The new online season leagues will save and display MLB Player stats, track player energy, allow for trades/injuries, and offer 40-man roster functionality.  Alongside this will be weekly live roster updates, available every week throughout the entire MLB season, tracking roster changes, addition of new MLB players (with correct attributes), and player attribute updates to reflect hot and cold streaks.  Lastly, The Show will offer the ability to view every game you've ever played online, complete with opponents, box scores, and game logs.  There is simply no better place to turn up the smacktalk and settle a little baseball rivalry than playing it out online in The Show.
The gameplay in The Show has been enhanced considerably with improved logic, animations and presentations resulting in a wider variety of hit types (including more choppers), improved ground ball friction, improved run down logic, and upgrades to the Throwing Meter, which will reflect each player’s arm strength based on attributes.  The ground ball friction will provide more realistic bounces and ground balls getting by the corner infielders when hit down either foul line allowing for extra bases when the ball rattles around in the left and right field corners.  Ball collision improvements now enable the ball to bounce off of any part of the batter's body and take the correct trajectory after impact.  If you dive for a ball and miss it, the ball can be smothered, kicked, and deflected, all outcomes following real life ball physics.  Comebackers to the mound can deflect off the pitcher’s body who can then turn a great looking 1-6-3 double play.  We have also added the always popular 3-6-3 double play, ability to rob HRs, dives, sliding catch plays, tumbles, rolls, over running bases, getting caught on a pick-off move when leaning the wrong way, base runner line drive reactions, multiple levels of check swings, and umpire reviews of HRs hit down the foul lines (they can get reversed!)—all new aspects of the gameplay that not only look great, but feel right.
MLB 10 The Show once again raises the overall level of detail and realism from customizable fan chants, to jumbotron animations, to crowd atmosphere.  Not to be outdone, stadium ambiance will be improved with the addition of HR/splash counters, fireworks, steam, noisemakers, towels, thunder sticks, crowd reaching over the rails, and crowd detail, such as interaction with vendors and placing Ks.  Mascots are also available for all teams and each will show off signature moves throughout the game.
The popular “Road to The Show” mode returns with version 4.0 featuring the addition of two new interactive training modes, new settings, and new presentations.  Interactive training will consist of a set of mini-games designed to improve a player’s fielding and pitching ability, adding to last year's introduction of batting and base running training.  In Road to The Show users will also have the new Game Watch and Game Completion options which allow the player to set how much of the game they wish to view.  “Franchise Mode” also returns to the game, including the 40-man roster, salary arbitration, waiver transactions and September call-ups.  Due to hit stores in March 2010, just in time for Spring Training, as the only officially licensed first party videogame exclusively for the PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 2, PSP (PlayStation Portable), and the PSP (PlayStation Portable) go, MLB 10 The Show is prepared to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience for all fans, new and old.
 
NEW FEATURES IN MLB 10 THE SHOW
 

All-Star Break (includes Home Run Derby and MLB All-Star Futures Game™) (PS3) – The long-awaited return of Home Run Derby will take place in MLB 10 The Show for PS3.  Fully implemented in our season modes and available as a stand-alone mode, Home Run Derby follows the MLB rules and flow.  The MLB All-Star Futures Game will also be available within season modes in its correct timeframe (just before the HR Derby).  See if your Road to The Show player is invited to either the Home Run Derby or the Futures Game!
Catcher Calling the Game (PS3) – The catcher will play a bigger role in season modes, Road to The Show, and exhibition games.  The catcher will give a sequence of signs and users will have the ability to change their indicator.  Specifically for Road to The Show, the feature will allow a catcher to calling the game.  This feature will give a new level of control to the catcher where he will have responsibility to select pitches and position himself to block balls that are in the dirt or wild.
Online Gameplay Improvements (PS3) – This year, the online gameplay experience has been improved a great deal as the game will detect and respond better to adverse network conditions along with reduced bandwidth to help the speed and flow of online gameplay.
User Controlled Pick-offs (PS3) – Want to surprise a base runner with a quick move or lull him to sleep?  The new pickoff mechanism will now allow users to choose from a quick, casual, or deceptive pick-off type.  In exhibition, season, and Road to The Show modes, you have the ability to decide which move you want to make as a pitcher.  As a base runner in Road to The Show you now have to pick up on the pitcher’s move or get thrown out leaning!
Custom Music, Fan Yells, and Chants – New to The Show this year, users can now assign music or a recording to an entire team, not just a player.  Edit tracks to assign batter walk-up music or record your own voice and assign it to play for the team or player during the situation of your choice.""
Movie Maker (PS3) – Newly added is the Movie Maker menu within the Pause Menu.  This will give the user the ability to select up to ten replays to add to a single movie and do all their editing from this menu.  The user will now be able to start recording their movie on a newly created timeline and then pause their movie, choosing different camera angles of their plays.  
New Stadiums (PS3) – MLB 10 The Show will offer 11 new stadiums.  In addition to all current MLB stadiums, five new Minor League venues are available, as well as classics parks now be available on the PS3 for the first time.  The classic stadiums include Forbes Field, Crosley Field, Polo Grounds, Shibe Park, Sportsman Park, and Griffith Stadium.


New Fielding and Pitching Training Modes/Practice Drills (PS3) – In MLB 10 The Show users will have the ability to choose from two new interactive training/practice modes.  The additions of pitching and fielding training sessions round out the Road to The Show training suite.  Fielding training will consist of two types of training –focus on the user's throwing with the new throw meter and focus on a combination of throwing and decision-making.  Pitching training will have two options—Knockout and Simulated Game, both focusing on control and accuracy, with goals provided for each session.  These training modes will extend to practice modes for both fielding and pitching and are a perfect way to polish and improve your baseball skills in The Show!

 

Road to The Show Version 4.0 (PS3) – Road to The Show (RTTS) 4.0 features the additions of two new option settings; RTTS Game Watch and RTTS Game Completion, that allow users to set how much of the game they wish to view.  With settings of All Pitches, All Fielding, Result Play, and Off, user's will have the choice to view every pitch of the entire game, or trim the viewing down to just the result pitch.  Users will now start their career in AA and will have to earn their spot in Spring Training.  In order to enforce good fundamental baseball, two new systems have been implemented.  The first is a mistake tracking system that will keep tabs on how users play the game and will penalize for throwing to the wrong base, not covering the right base for the out, etc.  The second feature is a new Green Light system that has been implemented to reward good base stealing and penalize those that shouldn't be stealing.  If a user continues to steal once the green light has been revoked, their playing time will diminish.  Once revoked, users will have to improve their speed and base running ability in order to regain the green light.  Finally, there is a new stat tracking system that keeps stats for your player’s career versus every pitcher or batter faced during the current season that can be accessed at any time.
Full Online Season Leagues (PS3) – Along with improvements to the traditional online leagues, MLB 10 The Show will offer fully functional online season leagues!  The new online season leagues will save and display MLB Player stats, track player energy, allow for trades/injuries, and offer 40-man roster functionality.
Weekly Live Roster – An updated live roster will be available every week throughout the entire season.  Included in the update will be all roster changes, addition of new MLB players (with correct attributes), and player attribute updates to reflect hot and cold streaks.
Online Game History – MLB 10 The Show now offers the ability to view every game you've ever played online, complete with opponents, box scores, and game logs. 
1-30 Player Season Modes (PS3) – Because roster control is an integral part of Franchise Mode, giving the user the ability to control one or all 30 teams is now essential to the mode.  To do this, the user has the option to select how many teams (or all teams) they wish to control right from the start of their franchise or season.
New Camera System (PS3) – MLB 10 The Show is set to raise the bar for sports gaming and offer the most robust and realistic camera system available.  Camera positioning will make you double take and make sure you’re not watching a live MLB telecast.   
Real-Time Presentations (PS3) – MLB 10 The Show has boosted the number of overall animations by capturing more than 1,250 new gameplay animations, more than 1,000 new presentation animations, and more than 400 personalized pitcher and batter animations.  To accompany this upgraded experience, The Show introduces a new broadcast camera for fielding that will make you feel like you're watching a live telecast.

Now you are a prisoner here. You are trapped in a maze where even the walls are death to touch. Grim robot thugs known as ""Automazeons"" stalk you relentlessly and you must systematically pulverize them with your laser gun before they eliminate you with theirs.
You are never safe on the planet Mazeon. Even when you've destroyed the mechanical heavies, Evil Otto, the mad and merciless mind behind the robot gangs, leaps out from where he's been observing the battle. You flee in panic because you know that you cannot kill Evil Otto and that, once he catches you, you'll never escape.
He will pound you to a lifeless pulp, grinning like a maniac all the while. Your only hope is to get out of the electrified maze before Evil Otto catches you.
If you do get out, you find yourself in another maze. Again the faceless robots shoot at you, again Evil Otto pursues you, again you must dodge and shoot and run ... into yet another maze. It's enough to drive you bonkers!

Also, embark upon thrilling action sequences that remain true to the spirit established in scenes such as Indy's pursuit of the motorcade in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine-cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the free-for-all aboard the tank in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

If you  played the original game, good news is you’ll be able to transfer your  save data and jump straight into all the new content on Nintendo Switch!
Monstrous Roster
Featuring a diverse cast of returning fan favorites, new variant  “Deviant” monsters, an all-new Elder Dragon Valstrax and a new endgame  boss Ahtal-Ka, you’ll have your hands full with unique quest targets and  gear to craft from them. For those of you that will be newly jumping  in, Deviant monsters are even more powerful variants of enemies you will  soon become familiar with, monsters that have survived previous hunter  encounters and have taken on new traits and abilities.
Hunt Your Way
Also building on MHGen’s Hunting Style system, we are introducing two brand new styles:

Alchemy Style offers a twist to the average hunting arsenal by giving  a barrel that, when shaken a bit, can yield items with special  properties, interesting buffs for your hunting party, or even unique  attacks. Pair this style with the Hunting Horn and Sword & Shield to  become to the ultimate support hunter!
Valor Style demands the ultimate knowledge of your target as you place a  bet on your health bar in exchange for powerful counter attacks. This  one is for the folks out there who like to live on the edge or are  looking to master flawless hunting methods.

All the gear, these two new styles, along with the existing four  (Guild, Striker, Adept and Aerial) and new Hunter Arts (super moves!)  add up to a near limitless amount of possibilities for you to  experiment, changing up your experience every time or customizing your  hunter to find a hunting type that feels personalized just for you.
Puttin’ the G in ChallenGe
So with all these possibilities, you’ll of course want to put your  build, as well as your skillset to the test. Or maybe you want to try  out how versatile you can actually be. Enter G Rank. The toughest  monsters await you, with new attacks and new behaviors. And, of course,  the best gear is locked behind felling these beasts. So make sure to  team up with up to 3 other hunters (local or online multiplayer) and  coordinate your Styles and Hunter Arts to come out victorious.

Developed under Codemasters’ exclusive worldwide agreement with    Formula One World Championship Limited, F1 2011 will come complete  with   all the official drivers, teams and circuits featuring in the  2011 FIA   FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™.
With a new focus on multiplayer gaming, including co-op Championships    and split-screen mode, F1 2011 will invite players to ‘Be The Driver,    Live the Life, Go Compete’ with a range of innovations, improvements   and  enhancements on and off the track. Set to be the most enthralling    season yet, the 2011 FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP features two  new   circuits in India and Germany, new drivers, rules, tyres as  Sebastian   Vettel seeks to defend his title.
Developed using Codemasters’ EGO Game Technology Platform F1 2011   will  deliver an unrivalled FORMULA ONE experience that puts players   into the  heart of the world’s most exciting sport, powered by cutting   edge  graphics, advanced physics systems and integrated network play.
• Go Compete! F1 2011 builds extensively on the multiplayer options   from  F1 2010. Split-screen racing is included for the first time in a    high-definition FORMULA ONE title. Competitive online racing is  extended   with 16 players going head-to-head in GRAND PRIX™ with up to 8  AI   drivers added to simulate the full grid of 24 drivers. An  innovative new   co-op Championship enables two players to lead their  favourite FORMULA   ONE team to Driver and Constructor glory across the  course of a  FORMULA  ONE season. These enhancements are complimented by  additional  quick fire  modes including Time Attack.
• New Circuits for 2011. Two stunning new additions to the race   calendar  extend the number of circuits to feature in F1 2011 to 19.   Players will  be able to debut ahead of the drivers on the Buddh   International  Circuit, the home of the first FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF   INDIA and players  will be able to test themselves on the iconic   Nürburging circuit for  the first time in High Definition, as this   legendary track returns for  the 2011 season.
• Be the driver, live the life. From the paddock to the track, F1   2011  takes players closer to the experience of being a FORMULA ONE   driver  than ever before. A new Parc Ferme area, an expanded and   revamped  Paddock, new Pit Lane, celebration and reaction cinematics and   an  enhanced media interaction system fully immerse players in the   glamour,  pressure and excitement of being a FORMULA ONE driver. Players   progress  from rookie to FIA FORMULA ONE DRIVERS’ WORLD CHAMPION in an   extensive  career mode where gamers fight to become priority driver  and  shape the  development of the car by performing well in races and   earning  performance upgrades.
• All the cars, all the stars. Fully licensed, F1 2011 features all   the  drivers set to contest the 2011 FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP,    including Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, Michael    Schumacher and Jenson Button. All 2011 teams are represented including    Ferrari, Red Rull Racing, Vodafone McLaren Mercedes and Lotus Renault  GP   in their iconic black and gold livery.
• KERS, DRS and more! F1 2011 includes all the new rule changes set   to  make this year’s season the most exciting yet. F1 2011 debuts DRS   (Drag  Reduction System) � the new system which enables drivers to   adjust the  rear wing on the car to give a boost of up to 10km. KERS   also returns,  giving players an extra 80BHP for up to 6.67 seconds,   enabling drivers  to blast past rivals. Combined, these systems   encourage close  wheel-to-wheel racing with new options for both defence   and attack. This  season’s new Pirelli tyres are faithfully simulated   in the game, and if  players push their car too hard they may  experience  a range of  authentic new damage failures.
• Full Day / Night Racing. The 2011 FORMULA 1 ETHIAD AIRWAYS ABU   DHABI  GRAND PRIX comes alive with a full day/ night transition which   recreates  the special atmosphere at this unique track. Every one of the   existing  circuits from the 2010 roster has been given a complete   visual overhaul.  New atmospheric effects, including dynamic clouds,   compliment a weather  system which features an advanced rain model that   affects on-track  grip. Powered by the EGO Game Technology Platforms,  F1  2011 pushes  forward the graphical standard of what can be achieved  in a  racing game.
• The world’s greatest cars, the most exciting racing. Building on   the  heritage of producing award-winning racing games for over a decade,    Codemasters is uniquely placed to realise the spectacle and   exhilaration  of racing 200MPH+ FORMULA ONE cars for all fans. F1 2011   can be tuned  for players from a wide range of skill levels, from the   casual gamer to  the hardcore simulation enthusiast and those in   between, with a range of  differing skill levels. A huge range of   vehicle variables can be tuned  to suit each player’s unique driving   style, or drivers can entrust their  Race Engineer to set their car up   and head straight onto the track. F1  2011 will support a comprehensive   range of racing wheels for the  ultimate racing experience.
• Unprecedented authenticity. Codemasters has used its unprecedented    access to the world of FORMULA ONE to connect the development team    directly with FORMULA ONE teams and tyre manufacturers. Extensive    consultancy has taken place with a range of FORMULA ONE professionals,    including race engineers, mechanics and drivers. This has been combined    with real world data including CAD and on-board telemetry to deliver a    race experience complete with authentic handling, accurate circuits  and   precisely modelled racing cars.
• EGO powered FORMULA ONE. F1 2011 is being developed on the EGO Game    Technology platform, evolved from the award winning EGO engine.   Enabling  Codemasters development talent to share tools and technology   across  Studios and Central Technology teams, the EGO Game Technology   Platform  empowers Codemasters game designers to realise their creative   visions  across multiple platforms featuring cutting edge graphics,   powerful AI,  advanced physics systems and integrated network play.

Take control of ASTRO the captain BOT and go on an epic VR rescue mission to save your fellow crew who are dispersed all over space.
The game takes full advantage of PS VR to invigorate the platforming genre with gameplay unfolding around you in 360 degrees. Your character reacts instantly and your jumps are ultra precise thanks to the increased depth of PS VR. While seated, moving your body lets you lean around corners to get a better view on the action and discover secret paths. You can also use your body to weave through the scenery and create a path for your character.
You will be running and jumping through city skylines, lush jungles, dark caves, and golden sandy beaches in 20 unique levels that all take advantage of PS VR. Each level features original traps and enemies, and contains 8 lost Bots for you to save.
To top it all off, six immense boss enemies stand between you and your lost crew. In VR, the scale of these juggernauts come through like never before and you feel incredibly small as they tower over you.
To guide your journey, you can rely on your trusted DUALSHOCK 4 controller which becomes the host to a bunch of cool gadgets: a hook shot, a water gun and ninja stars are few of the special weapons at your disposal. Use them in combination with your jumping and punching skills to blast off anyone standing in your way!
And if you are thirsty for more extreme platforming, the game offers 26 extra challenge levels specifically created to test your dexterity.
A new Hero is coming to PS VR, so join the ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission and be one of the first to experience the future of platform games!

Enjoy new Death Match and Campaign modes on Xbox Live or via System Link. Compete as one of six combat specialists across multi-mission campaigns. The warfare explodes with all the action, humor, and innuendos that Conker fans have come to know and love.
 
You also get the critically acclaimed single-player game, Conker’s Bad Fur Day, completely recreated for the Xbox with stunning graphics and unparalleled attitude.
 
* Team-focused, story-driven, Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay is at the heart of this shooter, pitting the noble Squirrels against the evil Tediz. Players can choose from a variety of scenario-based missions featuring two unique campaigns—Old War and Future War—with each mission featuring its own distinctly challenging gameplay mode. Campaign story lines, comprised of multiple missions played progressively, bring an innovative and fresh approach to team-based shooters and Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players.
* Elite squad action: Players choose from six character classes, including Skyjockey, Long Ranger, Grunt, Demolisher, Thermophile, and Sneaker, each with its own signature weapons and abilities. In Conker: Live and Reloaded, team composition has strategic and tactical advantages and implications.
* Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay, innovative campaign story lines, and distinctive humor all make for a great experience on Xbox Live. Online players strategize, cooperate, and communicate as a team in Campaign mode, or venture out solo against buddies in Deathmatch. Players can earn war medals, rise through the ranks, secure unlockables, and download new maps.
* Massive arsenal for maximum carnage: Devastating weapons include camera-guided rockets, an acid thrower, and loads of grenade types. Operate five types of vehicles including Sky Steed, Mule Bomber, R-Hog, Toad, and Tankus and various types of equipment such as anti-infantry sentries, medi-guns, and a snoop camera. Special abilities allow players to disguise themselves or feign death and sneak up on unsuspecting foes to unload a demoralizing array of attacks.
* Twisted and irreverent world of Conker: Over-the-top humor, characters, and gameplay dominate in every way with rude wit, lewd innuendoes, and ridiculous violence. The juxtaposition of the characters, Squirrels and Tediz, and their world is at the heart of the humor. The expressions, exclamations, and special effects bring out the true Conker flavor.
* Wildly bizarre single-player adventure: The critically acclaimed single-player game Conker’s Bad Fur Day is now on Xbox, fully recreated with amazing graphics and enhanced profanity. The game is full of hilarious situations, movie pastiches, off-the-wall puzzles, and crazy characters in an offbeat world, including horny bees, voluptuous sun flowers, singing piles of poo, and even Death himself.

Little does he  know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive,  irresistible freight train named Catherine.

With the advanced power of the Emotion Engine, the designers for NASCAR 2001 have been able to duplicate key driving points and strategies of some of the biggest names in the racing field. Gone are the days of one-dimensional AI, thanks to independent artificial intelligence routines geared towards each racer's personality--older drivers will wisely hold back until key moments, while the rookies and speed demons will be more prone to charging recklessly into turns. Thirty-five active drivers with their respective cars (complete with sponsors) are available to rip around 14 different tracks--including night races and (in a NASCAR game first) Daytona. Body deformation, particle effects (like smoke and fire), sparks, tire marks on the road, and wall marks ensure that it looks as good as it plays.

Although the sorcerer tries morphing into various fighters, Liu Kang punches him several times and finishes him with the Flying Kick, sending Shang Tsung through a pillar. Weakened, Shang Tsung tries to get up, but the room quakes. Emerging from a hallway, Goro appears and moves in on any fighter he sees. With Goro distracting everyone else, Shang Tsung creates a portal to Outworld and retreats. He's soon followed by Baraka, Goro, Reptile, Kano, and strangely Scorpion. Raiden appears afterwards and warns the remaining fighters to get off the island palace for it's collapsing into the sea. Everyone evacuates except Liu Kang and Kung Lao who fall into Goro's Lair.They escape back to the Wu Shi Academy but Baraka and the Tarkatan launch an attack on the Wu Shi Academy and capture Sonya. Raiden confirms that Shang Tsung is trying to lure Liu Kang and his allies to Outworld where he can order his henchmen to attack them and bide his time for power. If he's successful, Shang Tsung will conquer Earth without winning a Mortal Kombat tournament, which is cheating. The Shaolin Monks, Liu Kang and Kung Lao, journey through the nightmarish realm of Outworld to stop the sorcerer's plot. They are guided by Raiden and assisted by Johnny Cage. Throughout their journeys, they are joined by a mysterious princess named Kitana, meet familiar foes and eventually save Sonya and stop Shang Tsung. But the sorcerer is not the only person who wants Earth; the Emperor of Outworld wants Earth for his realm and he will stop at nothing until he gets it. "

Gameplay:It's just a pinball game, right? Hardly. It's a flipping adventure. Mario rolls through different worlds. Instead of performing his signature jump on enemies, Mario just steamrolls them in ball form.   Each pinball arena contains a door to the next level. You must shoot Mario into the door to open it and then shoot him through the door to advance to the next level. Of course, all your favorite baddies from the Mario universe stand in the way of Mario and the door.   In some levels, Mario can roll through special openings to face a boss character or pick up bonuses. Every time you knock out a bad guy, it leaves behind a coin. With those coins, you earn points. Toad also appears occasionally and hosts a shop where you can buy items. Buying an extra pipe is nice in times of need, or maybe you'd rather have the mushroom to transform into a super Mario ball.   Mario can also earn other bonuses. Once you defeat enough opponents, a question mark sometimes appears in the middle of the level. Once Mario rolls into it, bonus items appear in a box. Press the A Button to win the item that appears in the box, like an extra pipe to keep Mario from rolling past the flippers. The item can even be something bad, such as a reduction in points.   The controls are very, very simple. You just control the flippers at the bottom of the screen. However, the gameplay is so addictive that it's tough to stop once you get on a roll.
Features:
Play through the varied worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom.  
Collect Star Keys, defeat enemies, buy special items, and rack up the points as you rebound through dangerous locales full of familiar enemies.

Get ready for the fight of your life with EA SPORTS’ Fight Night 2004. Built from the ground up to deliver all the drama and pageantry of a heavyweight title bout, Fight Night is the most authentic boxing experience to date, sporting a dramatic new-school attitude, a dynamic new cinematic approach, and revolutionary boxing gameplay.

Total defensive control: An all new analog defense system emphasizes finesse and body control. Bob, lean, duck, and weave to draw your opponent in, then lay into them—make them miss and make them pay.
Fresh new attitude: Fight Nightcaptures the over-the-top showmanship and excitement of a championship fight with cinematic flair. Detailed 3-D crowds and painstakingly detailed arenas punctuate the action in the ring.
Deep Career mode: In-depth Create-a-Boxer and Career modes let players create themselves in the game and work their way up the ranks from chump to champ, picking up sponsors, upgrading skills, and traveling the world in pursuit of the big payday.
Realistic boxing violence: Physics-based action assures no two knockdowns will ever be alike. Swollen eyes and realistic effects highlight the physical nature of the sport.
Kings of the ring: The biggest and baddest boxers rule the ring in Fight Night. The game includes all of today’s contenders, like Roy Jones Jr., Shane Moseley, and Lennox Lewis, plus all-time greats like Mohammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Leonard, and more.
Customizable ring entrances: Assemble an entourage, choose your theme music, select your pyrotechnics, and set the tone for the fight to follow. Dark and threatening or bold and boisterous? It’s your call.

It lasted for  a couple of hours and did not end in a victory for any side. There were  no sides left after it ended.
The Moscow Metro did fulfill its alternative purpose as an enormous  bomb shelter – it did so almost perfectly. Most of the people who  hurried inside at the sounds of an air raid alert survived. They seem to  be the only ones who did.
The humanity was all but extinguished in the apocalypse it brought  upon itself, its last remains reduced to hiding in holes waiting for an  unlikely miracle – or, which seems much more probable after all those  years, simply waiting for the last supplies to run out. After all, there  is little hope of ever getting out of the Metro, for the world outside  turned into a poisoned nightmare where a human cannot survive without a  gas mask. Having a gasmask does not make continued survival all that  much more probable – many areas are still too irradiated to enter, and  the Surface in general is teeming with hideous creatures born of  radiation.
Grudges and enmity are sure to arise in times of need, and in this  world they blossom like never before. The survivors, who could probably  stand a chance of overcoming all the hardships and ridding the world  above of the mutants, were they united, nevertheless break up into  antagonistic groups. These groups vary in numbers, power and beliefs,  some of them control whole Metro lines, while the others are basically  independent station-cities. But, regardless of how powerful or impotent  such a “state” is, they are vying for control of the now-scarce  resources.
And this is the harsh and unforgiving world as you, Artyom, know it.  You know of no other, since you were born a few years before the War and  the memories of the time when you still lived outside are vague at best  and growing ever weaker, displaced with horrors that are your daily  routine now. Ever since you came to live in the Metro, you never left  the confines of the station which became your home, but an impending  danger forces you to leave. You will have to brave untold dangers,  traverse pitch-dark tunnels and irradiated ruins of the once beautiful  city to find a way to help your home station in its hour of desperate  need, and, perhaps, do something much greater than that.

Take charge of a band of mercenaries and journey with them into an epic and cinematic adventure in The Last Story for Wii.
The Last Story blends beautiful visual design with an  innovative real-time battle system and captivating tales of camaraderie.  Players will explore secret-filled locations scattered across Lazulis  Island, the heart of a human empire and scene of an unfolding drama that  will bring hostilities between two ancient races to a head. Among the  band of mercenaries under your control is Zael, a warrior imbued with  rare powers and intrigued by the notion of one day becoming an  honourable knight. But as Zael and his mercenary friends reach the  island’s capital city and find themselves drawn into official affairs,  they discover that honour is one quality that can never be taken for  granted.
Central to gameplay in The Last Story is a combat system that  calls on players to take the lead in employing tactical teamwork. By  using the special “Gathering” ability, the character under your control  will become the focal point for enemy aggression, freeing team-mates up  to perform specific tasks or attacks and recover their health. Balancing  out your use of Gathering is key, as constantly taking the hits for  your team is not an option!
The Last Story draws you deeper into the drama of each battle  by seamlessly blending cinematic cut-scenes with the combat, and also  keeps things flowing by having characters discuss key plot points during  normal gameplay – advancing the story without breaking from the action.  The option of using either an automatic or manual attack system means  players of all skill levels can alter the level of challenge to suit  their abilities. And once you feel confident that you’ve mastered the  finer points of fighting, there’s a whole other arena in which to test  your skills, with The Last Story offering cooperative and competitive  online battles for 2-6 players.
Exclusively for Wii, The Last Story draws you into a world of  beauty and breathless action, inviting you to become part of a band of  friends at the centre of an unforgettable adventure.

You are B.J. Blazkowicz, a U.S. Army Ranger recruited by the OSA and the Allies' top specialist in covert operations, heavy weapons, and assassination. Hitler's head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, is twisting science and the occult into an army capable of annihilating the Allies. The balance of victory is in your hands.




Mission mode: Assume the role of B. J. Blazkowicz, an Army Ranger tasked with infiltrating the deepest realms of the Third Reich to thwart Himmler's occult and genetic experiments. Initially teamed with another OSA operative, Agent One, Blazkowicz begins his journey in Egypt, where he'll uncover the early stages of Himmler's plans. After being grounded by anti-aircraft artillery fire, he must overcome capture and the death of his new partner as he battles throngs of the Fuhrer's brainwashed soldiers and hordes of zombies in an epic campaign that spans the globe—from Egypt to Norway to the heart of Nazi Germany.
Twisted and frightening enemies: Including SS guards that patrol the forests and secret military installations, zombies unleashed in ancient crypts, mutant X-creatures (the products of hideous secret X-lab facilities), and the terrifying Occult Priest.
Co-op action: The Allies' only remaining hope in the battle against the insidious Reich lies in the hands of two men: B. J. Blazkowicz and his new partner Agent One. The Xbox-exclusive, split-screen co-op mode allows two friends to work together through the entire single-player campaign.
Multiplayer warfare: Using Xbox LIVE® or System Link, the game's Multiplayer modes pit players in a team-based Axis-versus-Allies contest for front-line domination, where multiple player classes must mobilize and work together to accomplish mission objectives. Styles of play range from Objective mode all the way to a team-based Elimination mode. The battlefields are designed specifically for play on the Xbox, and gamers can play up to eight against eight for fast and furious combat. Xbox LIVE players can invite other players from their buddy list to join their game or jump straight into the action, using Xbox LIVE Matchmaking to find a favorite style of gameplay. With the Xbox LIVE Communicator and full voice-masking capabilities, players can verbally coordinate attacks, communicate enemy positions, or scream for a medic.
Made for the Xbox: Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War delivers Dolby Digital 5.1 audio; new monsters, weapons, and useable items; an expanded story line, including new missions, co-op play, and full Xbox LIVE capabilities; and System Link multiplayer support for the definitive Xbox experience.
Tactical combat: Every situation is different, and players must survey each potential combat situation and decide how best to approach the combat, by using either stealth or overwhelming firepower. With a robust scripting system and life-like A.I. and animation systems, tactical combat reaches all-new levels.

In this dino-tastic adventure, players get some hands-on time to hunt        and clean fossils, and revive and battle vivosaurs. A fossil park is        hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs        created from dinosaur fossils into competition. Fossil Fighters from all        over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out        who will be crowned champion.

 Players excavate and clean fossils. New giant fossil rocks (containing          complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided)          add to the fun of the cleaning process. 
 Once the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into          Vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. The          better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the Vivosaurs          are in battle. 
 Strategy is key in battles. Players must put forth teams of three          vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power          advantage over opponents. 
 New “super evolver” vivosaurs evolve into new forms with the help of          gold fossils. 
 Players can compete in matchmaking battles or upload their best team          to see how it fares against others. Players can also download          additional vivosaurs and events.

Wario is a man of many talents and in        this game it’s all about making the most of a host of disguises, each        with their own special abilities, as our fiery-tempered hero enters his        TV to search for the legendary Wishstone which promises to grant the        holder’s wishes. All the wacky humour you'd expect from a Wario title        combines with rich gameplay to make a platformer like no other.       Beginning as a thief, Wario will unlock seven more disguises throughout        his adventures. The stylus allows you to switch disguises on the fly, by        drawing symbols on the Touch Screen. A circle around Wario’s head will        transform him into a helmet-wearing spaceman who can fire powerful laser        beams. At other times, artistic abilities might be called for and you        can change into Arty Wario who sports a fetching beret and can paint new        blocks to reach previously inaccessible areas. Or don your cape to        become a superhero by the name of Wicked Wario and blow into the DS        microphone to fly into the air. When Wario is involved, nothing is        predictable, but join him on his quest and fun is guaranteed!•Ten huge levels each themed on different TV shows including pyramids        and cruise ships•New abilities can be added to each disguise over the course of the game•Replay levels once you have unlocked new powers and see what hidden        treasures you can uncover•Open treasure chests by completing a range of fun mini-games, tapping,        tracing and colouring-in on the Touch Screen Source - www.Nintendo.com  "

Scene It? ® Box Office Smash for Xbox 360 brings movie and trivia fans together for a game that provides hours of laughter. Challenge your friends and family to see whose movie knowledge reigns supreme while you relive some of your favorite moments from the silver screen.
With all-new questions, more high-definition (HD) movie clips, and several new puzzle types, you have a trivia game overflowing with images plus audio and video clips from hundreds of films you know and love.
The new game lets up to four teams challenge one another from the comfort of your living room or across the miles via Xbox LIVE®. With the new Xbox LIVE experience, Scene It? Box Office Smash is the first game that lets you virtually put yourself into the game through custom avatars that respond to your play and react to one another throughout the course of the game.




New movies, questions, puzzle challenges: It's not just trivia—it's trivia about movies you love, with hundreds of all-new questions, audio clips, photo stills, and HD movie clips never seen before in any Scene It? game. All 22 puzzle types have been designed to provide the ultimate multiplayer experience on Xbox 360.
Pixel Flix: This new game lets you try to name the film after watching an old-school, eight-bit-style animation of a famous scene.
Celebrity Ties: This is a ""six degrees of separation"" challenge in which you must link together a series of clues to guess the answer.
Which Is Which: In this game, test your power of observation as you try to determine which of two similar movie stills match a particular movie.
Worldwide movie trivia: Movie fans in France, Italy, German, Spain, and the U.K. have even more to love, with content from some of their favorite local films included in versions of the game sold in their countries.
Online multiplayer: Airplane flights are expensive, and your friends are everywhere. Solution? A Scene It? match over Xbox LIVE. Better than a phone call, playing over Xbox LIVE builds new memories with old friends and the opportunity to test your knowledge against friends or movie buffs around the world with several new online multiplayer modes.
At the movies: With the new Xbox LIVE experience, you can put yourself into the game through custom avatars that respond to your play and react to one another throughout the course of the game.
More from Xbox LIVE: With downloadable content available via Xbox LIVE Marketplace and a content tracking system that minimizes question repeats, you always have a fresh play experience.
Big Button Pad: With the intuitive wireless Big Button Pad, even the most console-phobic person will play, and maybe even win. The game is available with four wireless Big Button Pads, or without for aficionados who already own them from the previous Xbox 360 game Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action.

Only by locking Bowser away can Yoshi convince Hongo to release the rest of the island, so he sets out to progress through the chapters of the book...

Characters: Yoshi, Bowser, Egglings, Hongo, various spirits

How to progress through the game: Each course is controlled by a spirit: one who loves money, one who loves fast things, one who loves friendliness, etc. They will set out guidelines for the course, such as collecting fruit to free a certain number of Egglings, finding a certain number of coins or destroying a certain number of enemies. By satisfying that spirit’s requirements, players pass the course.

Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Yoshi can jump and stick out his tongue to eat fruit or enemies, but the main feature of the game is the tilt mechanism. By moving the Game Boy Advance SP side to side, players tilt the world around Yoshi, causing enemies to roll around, swinging ships and pendulums and bouncing items all over the place. An impassable wall will become a climbable slope, or a rolled-up carpet will become a long platform – all of the environments require players to master not only button presses but also tilt movements to progress.

Players get to experience school life in Persona 3.

These cards hold your Persona summons, and by combining cards, you can make a new Persona.

THE AUTHORITY IN WWE VIDEO GAMES RETURNS WITH WWE 2K16!
The newest addition to the flagship WWE franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new WWE Superstars, Divas and Legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
Features 
•Largest Roster Ever: Offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin alongside Seth Rollins, Daniel Bryan, Dean Ambrose, Bad News Barrett, Paige and Finn Bálor, WWE 2K16 includes the largest roster in WWE games history
-The roster contains an unprecedented combination of current WWE Superstars and Divas, emerging NXT talent, WWE Hall of Famers and WWE alumni from multiple eras
•Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator: Fans who pre-order WWE 2K16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator:
-T-800 from The Terminator and T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
•2K Showcase: The franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in WWE 2K16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in WWE history. Along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•MyCareer: The franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from NXT to WWE to earn a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame. In addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•Creation Suite: Building on last year’s foundation, WWE 2K16’s Creation Suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including Create a Diva, Create a Championship, Create an Arena, and Create a Show. Key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including Create a Superstar, Create an Entrance, Superstar Studio and Community Creations.
•WWE Universe: WWE 2K16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. In addition, for the first time, Superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•Online: Completely overhauled based on fan feedback, WWE 2K16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the WWE Games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•Soundtrack: Players can customize their in-game music through the addition of Superstar entrance music to the WWE 2K16 Jukebox. Additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•Gameplay Improvements: WWE 2K16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest WWE gameplay experience to date:
-Improved Controls: The controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. This change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. WWE 2K16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. Opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-New Reversal System: The reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  Each Superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces Major and Minor reversals for select moves. Minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. Major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. Successful Major Reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-New Pin System: The new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. If the opponent kicks out, a Superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. Dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. There is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. Rope Breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. In line with WWE live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-Chain Wrestling: New positions and attributes allow players to distinguish Superstars from one other. There can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-Working Holds: Working holds are new for WWE 2K16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. Just like on WWE programming, Working Holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-Improved AI: WWE 2K16 sees big improvements to the AI for Superstars, referees and managers.

•Additional Improvements: WWE 2K16 also includes an improved Submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.

Thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-Visual Upgrades: This year’s title features several thousand new animations.

The most appealing thing about this game is that it looks nothing like any other game ever made, it looks like watermark in motion where you use the joystick as a paintbrush to cast spells by drawing them on screen.The story is you are a goddess in a wolf's body and are trying to defeat the evil dragon Orochi who comes every hundred years to collect a maiden sacrifice from the village of Kamiki and lands darkness upon the land. You have a little bug side kick called Issun who can cast spells my using the power of painting. Eventually you defeat Orochi only to find out that there is a greater threat in the world and that you need to clear all of Japan from this evil.The gameplay is very familiar to the 3D Zelda games, with the player acquiring different abilities as he/she goes through different areas battling demons and creatures some of which are more challenging bosses. The game truly looks stunning and blows away games with much better graphics because of the art direction and originality of form. Definitely one of the gems of the PS2 and so late in its lifespan.

This is Electronic Arts' premiere racing game for the Nintendo 64 console. Here's some specifics:

See some of the best graphics the Nintendo 64 can produce.
Race in 3 different classes, with each new class unlocked as you complete the circuits. There's even two special cars to unlock after that!
Find the 3 flower boxes in each race to unlock secret cheats and gain the upper hand on the competition.
Be sure to look out for the point boxes, as they unlock previously inaccessible multiplayer arenas.
There are numerous shortcuts and alternate routes to travel, so choose the fastest path to guarantee yourself a win. But remember, you only get 3 laps!

So what exactly are the tracks like? Are they simple child's play? Of course not! Each is more challenging than the last, with six huge courses in total:

Coventry Cove: Take a trip through the quiet countryside in this track. You can jump over boats, barrel through barns, and drive through an old castle. You might get crushed by a crane if you aren't careful.
Mount Mayhem: This race takes place on a lonely but large mountainside. Take a chance on the ski jump (complete with a crowd), or even catch a glimpse of a UFO (odd, aren't they usually in the desert?). But watch out for the helicopters, they may get you if you stray too far of the road.
Inferno Isle: It's beter than Jurrasic Park; you get to race around a tropical island, and without getting eaten by dinosaurs! Notable places are the authentic deserted villages, pirate battles, and a volcano flowing with lava. That's one hot bath you don't want to take.
Sunset Sands: Have you ever wanted to see the pyramids? Now's your chance to in this desert-themed level. There are plenty of booby traps, elevator rides, and huge statues just like the real thing. Taking the wrong way has proven to decrease your chances of winning, so be on the alert at all times.
Metro Madness: Ah, the big city. They're always full of things to do, and this race is no exception. Stop at the casino/hotel for a taste of Vegas, rush through parking lots, smash through a movie theater, or race a subway down its tracks. There are no cops either, so the only thing stopping you is yourself!
Wicked Woods: It's Halloween all over again folks. Spooks and scares lay at every turn. There are two ways to tackle almost anything here. Will you go through the cathedral's doors or the windows up top? Will you go around the dragon or right in front of him? Will you stay on the normal path the entire race, or go on one with giant pumpkins? If you're really daring, you can even take a trip through a haunted house!

Take a friend along the races for even more craziness if you'd like. But even crazier is the multiplayer mode, Beetle Battle.

Catch the beetles of all six colors and head for the exit!
Getting smashed loses you a beetle, so don't get taken out.
Use cool power-ups like rockets, shields, and even the ability to flip your opponents' cameras!
There are 9 arenas in all, six of which must be unlocked in the championship mode.

If all that doesn't make you excited to play this game, I don't know what will. If you want a chaotic, non-linear racer to play on your Nintendo 64, then this game will definitely satisfy. "

Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort’s defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane’s chocolates! And then there’s Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.In the game of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron’s romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince. "

Together, they threaten to the throw the entire continent of        Archanea back to an age of chaos and war. Now, it's up to young Prince        Marth and his small band of loyal followers to rise up and rally all        those left in the land to make one last desperate push to free Archanea        from the tyranny of the Shadow Dragon.
How to progress through the game: Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy setting. Players alternate        turns with opponents, moving their pieces (units) and attacking enemy        units on the battlefield. There are dozens of units and different        weapons and magic spells, each with its own strategic        benefits-high-flying Pegasus knights move effortlessly over varied        terrain, fast-moving mounted cavaliers can use swords and lances,        unarmed curates use healing staves to mend the wounds of other units and        so on.
Characters: Many groups play a part in a story but undoubtedly        the story's protagonist, Prince Marth, will be the focus for most. Marth        has been featured in the Super Smash Bros. series and has been        extremely popular within those games, but this is his first time        starring in a Fire Emblem game in the United States. At Marth's        side is a support of fearless fighters, including the brave Caeda, a        princess of the Talys kingdom. Other major characters include the evil        sorcerer Gharnef and the sole surviving descendant of the royal House        Archanea, Princess Nyna.

 Fire Emblem returns to its roots with a total overhaul of an          NES classic never before released in America. New features include          touch-screen controls, multiple save options and easy-to-follow          tutorial chapters that shed new light on Marth's story. New players          can jump into the action, even if they've never played a Fire Emblem game before. 
 Take the battle online and clash with players around the world over          Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. You can also borrow units to use in your          army, talk with friends using the built-in Nintendo DS microphone and          even buy rare and powerful items from the Online Shop using in-game          currency. 
 You are the general: Shape your army to suit your strategy by          selecting from dozens of characters with unique spells and abilities.          But guide your army wisely, because if a character falls on the          battlefield, he's lost forever. 

Special Features:

 Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is the first to offer players a          chance to test their skills against other players in combat.

With only 30 days to complete the mission before his emergency oxygen supplies ran out, Olimar will never forget the Pikmin who aided him in his hour of need.
But home isn’t always as sweet as it should be, and it turns out Olimar’s intergalactic employer, Hocotate Freight, has fallen deep into debt in his absence. As the firm’s President regales the whole sorry tale to Olimar, the weary explorer inadvertently drops a trinket obtained on his travels.
When this meagre scrap of metal is valued at a whopping 100 Pokos, the solution to Hocotate Freight’s problems becomes instantly clear.
Olimar will simply have to return to the dangerous planet and take charge of the Pikmin once more. After all, if things just lying around back there are worth 100 Pokos, raising the cash necessary to repay the loan without a restrictive 30-day time limit should be simple. Right?

Set buildings  on fire to force garrisoned troops out and use your units’ special  abilities to turn the tide of the battle. Naval combat also offers more  variety with the addition of coastal battles. Islands can work as  effective cover for your ships, while sand bars and reefs can be used as  traps against an enemy fleet.  Accessible and in-depth empire-building gameplay:  A streamlined User Interface makes management of your kingdom much  easier. Build and govern cities, recruit and train troops, conduct  diplomacy and manage your agents – each feature is now introduced with  comprehensive tutorials, gradually revealing the depth of the Shogun 2  campaign map – the heart and soul of the Total War experience.

Now we want to see what you've got. The WarioWare:  D.I.Y. game lets players create the same kind of microgames that are the        hallmark of the WarioWare series. Players design every  aspect of        their creations, including graphics, animation, music and rules.
Features:

 Do It Yourself! Take on the role of game designer and create  your own          microgames by crafting everything from artwork, animations,  music and          action instructions. 
 WarioWare: D.I.Y. comes with more than 90 pre-made games  to          play, but players who have access to a broadband Internet  connection          can wirelessly download a virtually endless supply of  user-generated          games, or upload their own creations to share with the world. 
 When creating games, players can utilize a library of pre-made          graphics and sound samples, borrow elements from other  microgames on          their system, or start from scratch. 
 Sharing new content is the real key to WarioWare: D.I.Y.,  and          there are a number of ways for players to participate: 
 Using a local wireless connection, friends can swap micro-games,           comics and music they have created. 
 After the game launches, Nintendo will regularly make new  micro-games          available for download to players who have access to a broadband           Internet connection. 
 From time to time, Nintendo will challenge WarioWare: D.I.Y. players to create games based on a specific theme. Nintendo will  make          the best submissions available for download to players with a  wireless          broadband Internet connection. 
 Players can upload items to their Storage Crate in the Warehouse           (wireless broadband Internet access required). These products  can then          be downloaded by any of the friends with whom they have  exchanged          friend codes. 
 If you want to take a break from creating and playing games, why  not          try your hand at a comic strip? WarioWare: D.I.Y. includes  all          the tools artists need to compose their own four-panel comic  strips. 
 Players who have a Wii™ console can add another dimension to  their          game. By downloading the WarioWare: D.I.Y. Showcase game  from          Nintendo's WiiWare™ service, players get access to 72 more          micro-games, and can experience the games they created with  their          Nintendo DS™ system on their TV. Each of the elements in these  new          games then becomes a part of the player's toolbox. The WiiWare  game          also includes an unlockable multiplayer mode that lets up to  four          people play micro-games competitively (additional accessories  required          and are sold separately).

Characters can be approached but will offer different responses and be found in different places, while new clues and gameplay paths can be followed. The title follows Harry Mason, as he attempts to unravel the mystery of his missing daughter, Cheryl. A broken man, Mason’s investigations lead him to the mist-shrouded, snowy streets of Silent Hill: a malevolent town where the shadows play host to a wealth of evil, misshapen creatures.  Also new to Shattered Memories is a psyche profile element, which monitors every aspect of player’s reactions – from where they explore first, items that have been examined, and their reaction to those they meet. Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems. The psyche profile will adapt Harry’s actions as and when he meets normal-looking people or the game’s many inhuman denizens. "

Based on the all-new CGI TMNT movie, Ubisoft’s TMNT™ video game takes place in New York City, a city plagued with fast-moving shadows and attacks from strange creatures. Could the wealthy and mysterious Max Winters be involved? New York City needs the Turtles now more than ever but they face their most trying time both as heroes and as brothers. With the fate of the City and their family at stake, it’s up to Leonardo with Zen Master Splinter to restore unity and ninja discipline to the Turtles. Join the Ninja Turtles team and experience unique acrobatic navigation, collaborative combat and powerful fighting moves. Engage in over-the-top Ninja action to reunite the Turtles and save New York City.
Features

Embody All Four Famous Turtles Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are playable, each with unique acrobatic moves, weapons and combat skills, such as Michelangelo’s fast nunchuk face slap and Raphael’s powerful Sai throw.
Extends the TMNT Movie Experience The video game uses the same dark and dangerous environments and same themes in the new TMNT movie. Will the Turtles be able to unite against the odds or will sibling rivalries create an unstoppable rift between the brothers? Only the player’s abilities can determine the outcome for the family.
Intense Ninja Fighting By harnessing the power of Ninjitsu, the four Turtles have become masters of combat. Leonardo shows a calm discipline when he faces his foes, attacking carefully and masterfully. Donatello’s bow staff can be used to reach distant enemies and as a pivot for him to swing himself around the arena. Michelangelo is a fast, flamboyant, energetic fighter, good for quick slashes with nearby enemies but for powerful direct attacks nothing beats the intensity of Raphael’s powerful Sai punches.
Unique Acrobatic Navigation The Turtles jump from rooftop to rooftop, scale tall buildings, dive into sewers and race through every corner of the city to confront their enemies. Using the Jade Engine (Prince of Persia franchise), Ubisoft’s acclaimed Montreal development team brings a unique fast-paced navigation element to the Turtles gameplay.
Powerful Tag Team Moves Together the Turtles can team up to reach locations unattainable alone, or use their unique individual abilities to find alternate routes and secret areas of New York City. By pairing up in combat, the Turtles can leverage their combined powers to create a multitude of devastating attacks to cripple the enemy.
Diverse Enemies and Bosses Characters from the movie and the original comic book series creep out of the shadows to face the Turtles. From the Purple Dragon Street Gang to the infamous Foot Clan, a new group of enemies lurks in the sewers. Find out what their plan is and how the Turtles can stop them.

You play Adam Jensen, an ex-SWAT specialist  who's been  handpicked to oversee the defensive needs of one of  America's most  experimental biotechnology firms. Your job is to  safeguard company  secrets, but when a black ops team breaks in and  kills the very  scientists you were hired to protect, everything you  thought you knew  about your job changes
Badly wounded during the attack, you have  no choice but   to become mechanically augmented and you soon find  yourself chasing  down leads all over the world, never knowing who you  can trust. At a  time when scientific advancements are turning athletes,  soldiers and  spies into super enhanced beings, someone is working very  hard to  ensure mankind's evolution follows a particular path.
You need to discover where that path lies.  Because when  all is said and done, the decisions you take, and the  choices you make,  will be the only things that can change it.

A divided near-future: discover a time of great technological  advancement, but also a time of chaos and  conspiracy. Mechanical augmentations of the human body have divided society between those who can afford  them, and those who can't. Opposing  forces conspire from the shadow to  control the destiny of mankind: a human  revolution is coming.


A perfect mix of action  and role-play: the game uniquely combines action-packed close-quarter takedowns with intense shooting, offering a vast array of  character augmentations and upgrades for  the many weapons at your disposal. Unlock new abilities and  increase  your stealth, social, hacking or combat skills: the game  rewards all styles of play and approaches. Determine  how you want your character to evolve,  based on how you want to play the game.


Choices and  consequences: shoot your way through your enemies, sneak up behind them without being traced, hack systems to retrieve crucial information,  or use your social skills to extract  information from key characters - there are always choices, multiple approaches, multiple paths and  multiple tools at your disposal. Choose your playing style and face the consequences of your actions: you decide how the story unfolds.

Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

Is it a new game? Is it FIFA 99? Or is it just a rehash of the old version and an attempt to remind everyone, six months after FIFA 98 came out, that EA splurged and bought the license to the actual tournament itself this year? One thing for sure, it has a lot fewer teams on the roster. Thankfully it also has some new tactical elements and in-game management options that add a lot to the game's already awesome gameplay. But is it worth it? Well, that's sort of a personal question.Like FIFA 98, World Cup 98 is chock-full of moves. There's plenty for the novice to learn, including flick-passes, long volleys, and diving headers on goal. For the adept, there's an easy to use passback system, to make the most of those ample corners and get the opposition's defense sweating a little. Football illuminati will find a fistful of special moves that are a cinch to pull off, and after an hour or so, you'll be bicycle-kicking like Pele and performing a bizarre array of MC Hammer-inspired footwork to mesmerize and confuse the opposition. The beauty of both FIFA 98 and World Cup 98 is that, despite the volume of control possibilities, you can still play a pretty competitive game without any of the fancy stuff. Just run, pass, and shoot. And pick up the rest on your own time.World Cup 98 has a wealth of new in-game management and strategic control options. Before the game, you can set up three different custom formations (labeled IGM 1, 2, and 3) that can be switched during play at the touch of a button, er... OK, three buttons. In addition, the new version offers plays you can run, including an offsides trap, to (guess what?) draw the enemy offsides, a through ball run, to set up breakaway passes, and more. These simple plays provide an easy and powerful means to control non-ballcarriers, allowing more advanced players to pick apart the opposition. It's funny how things like a play book are taken for granted with a football title, yet we're so refreshingly surprised when a rudimentary one shows up in a soccer game. All cynicism aside, it's a great addition to gameplay.While there are dozens of new real-time management options out on the pitch, there's really nothing new behind the scenes. Granted, FIFA 98's plethora of management features remain. You can still go berserk and set your team's strategy to its offensive maximum, and set each player's individual attacking bias and aggression level to full, and then watch the rabid zealots swarm around the ball like angry bees (and lose the game with one good enemy through-pass). You can still create a bizarre race of puffy-haired redhead clones, and you can make your front line supersonic at the expense of all ball-carrying skill by tweaking their stats. Versatile, but nothing new.Like its predecessor, World Cup 98 has terrific AI, which means more than just the confidence that when you pass the ball blindly downfield, there'll be someone there to pick it up. The CPU defense is tough on hotdoggers. You won't get past the amateur difficulty setting by just holding down the sprint button and sending your center striker downfield on a solo mission. Thankfully, a smart AI encourages you to find creative ways to move the ball around the field and exploit enemy weaknesses. The default settings for player aggression leave your CPU-controlled teammates a little lackluster, especially on defense. However, with a couple of tweaks in the team management screens, they'll start going for it. You'll also find that the AI takes team ratings very seriously, and switching teams feels like playing a different game entirely. After missing pass after pass with Jamaica, it's refreshing to really kick some ass with Italy. That said, the AI feels essentially the same this time around.Graphically, both the original FIFA 98 and this version are loaded with amazingly lifelike polygonal animations of dozens of moves. There is no denying the realism of the short flick-pass or the sheer joy of sadistically slide-tackling the enemy goalie after he denies you your glory. Red card, shmed card, it's just so darn fun, and it looks so good you won't be able to resist. EA promised that the new version would offer a significantly higher frame rate and smoother screen scrolling, but if anything, World Cup 98 feels choppier than its predecessor. The frame rate seems lower and the anti-aliasing is less smooth on the players. Although, the entire screen seems a little less foggy, and more in focus, so perhaps they've just removed a layer of the N64's patented soft-focus visual trickery. The most noticeable visual improvements seem to have occurred in miscellaneous graphical trivia. The jerseys look better. The various option screens have all been given a face-lift. Plus, post-goal grandstanding (and reciprocal goalie pouting) has been expanded to include a number of new animations. Some of these goalies get pissed. Unfortunately, product placement has gone from cute (Fuji ads on the sidelines) to irritating (the score is now brought to you by Snickers - right on the score panel - every time). Argh.Fantastic commentary and an unlockable set of eight historically brilliant World Cup-winning teams from the past round out the game. Is it worth it? Well, downsizing from nearly 200 teams to only 48 is pretty drastic, but only the die-hard real-life soccer enthusiast would probably even care. Most of us are content to duke it out with Italy or Brazil and probably won't miss Antigua. However, it somehow irks me that the perfectly rendered stadiums are all in France. Yeah, yeah, I know. That's where the World Cup is happening this year - France. Francophile or not, die-hard soccer fanatics will find that the added tactical possibilities of World Cup 98 are worth the ticket price. The rest of us may want to just wait for the next FIFA game. "

Then guide Kirby as he sets off on grand        adventures in a hand-sculpted clay world.

Transformations include a submarine, rocket and tank. In        underwater levels, Kirby dons a swim mask. If his power level gets too        low, a clay bandage appears on his head.
FEATURES:

 Kirby comes to life in a world of clay, which creates a beautiful          backdrop for Kirby's adventure. 
 You take control of Kirby with the stroke of a stylus and draw on the          GamePad touch screen to guide Kirby through the world. 
 Use the GamePad to control Kirby's many transformations in unique new          ways. 
 The intuitive drawing mechanic is a spiritual successor to Kirby:          Canvas Curse for Nintendo DS that builds on the game play and takes it          in a new direction.
