As Monster Scouts, players can recruit wild monsters to build a team and        battle against other players in this turn-based role-playing game. Each        year, monster scouts from around the world gather to compete for the        title of world’s greatest scout. Players crash-land on a mysterious        island after their airship is struck by lightning. They must rescue        their missing passengers and crew members by fighting various enemies        using their own monster parties. The only way off the island is to solve        its many mysteries.

 Become the world’s greatest Monster Scout in Dragon Quest          Monsters: Joker™ 2, a spinoff of the fan-favorite DRAGON          QUEST core series. Players scout and collect monsters in order to          build a team to battle enemies. 


 When a player’s party encounters other monsters in a battle, they can          try to recruit those monsters with their scouting skills. A meter on          the top screen indicates the chance that players can scout a monster.          The higher the number, the higher the chance the monster will join a          player’s party. 


 More than 300 different monsters are available to scout and          synthesize. By synthesizing two different monsters, players can create          new, more powerful monsters. These monsters can be customized using          more than 240 skill trees. Some monsters return from previous DRAGON          QUEST games, while others are new. 


 In battles, monsters level up to learn new skills and become more          powerful. 


 Players can battle their monster teams against one another using a          local wireless connection. Or, using a broadband Internet connection,          they can connect to Nintendo® Wi-Fi Connection to battle against other          players. 


 The Wi-Fi World Tournament lets players battle against other monster          teams around the world. 


 The game supports a variety of Tag Mode options that let players          connect and share data with others: 

- Players who connect via Tag Mode with owners of DRAGON QUEST VI®:        Realms of Revelation™ or DRAGON QUEST IX: Sentinels of the        Starry Skies™ can scout monsters from those games.
- Players who connect via Tag Mode with other Dragon Quest Monsters:        Joker 2 players can battle against them and have a chance to scout their        monsters without affecting their games.

Come Out and Play – On Mario’s Turf Four great sports make their  move to the Mushroom Kingdom: volleyball, basketball, hockey and  dodgeball. Having four complete sports in one complete package is a  great value for Mario™ fans, sports fans and everyone in between.
FEATURES:
The  cast of Mushroom Kingdom characters get together to play sports – Mario  style. While the basic rules of the games apply, each one includes some  magical Mario twists like coins and special items that ramp up the  craziness and fun.
While playing, gathering coins will build up  bonus points. So when players score a point or basket, they also get the  added bonus.
 Players can also  collect items to use against their opponents. For example, when the  opposing team passes the basketball to each other, players can throw a  Green Shell at the player to distract them while they receive the pass.
Each  character has a signature move that’s almost impossible for opponents  to stop. For example, when Mario’s unique special move is activated in  basketball, Mario swirls into the air and dunks from anywhere on the  court.
In the field of play, a variety of tricks will keep players  on their toes. On DK Dock, the volleyball court will continually slide  to the left and right. On Bowser Jr. Blvd, the basketball court has  bonus circles that frequently appear, offering both positive bonuses or  negative points that result in extreme point swings.
Play with  friends and family at home or online! Up to four players can play  cooperatively or competitively in two-on-two or three-on-three matches.* * Additional accessories required and are sold separately.

Pokémon Battle Revolution lets you copy the Pokémon you have captured and raised in Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl on your Nintendo DS to Wii for epic 3D battles against Trainers all over the world! Pokémon Battle Revolution begins the moment you step into Pokétopia; a theme park made up of 10 different Colosseums custom-built for Pokémon battles. As you explore Pokétopia you will be able to customise the look of your trainer, unlock cool secrets and watch your favourite Pokémon fight it out in spectacular style against opponents from all over the world! In Colosseum mode, you will challenge trainers around Pokétopia; earning the right to fight tougher opponents and unlocking secret content as you go. Some of the secrets you unlock can be sent from Pokémon Battle Revolution to your copy of Pokémon Diamond or Pokémon Pearl. Even if you don’t have a copy of Pokémon Diamond or Pokémon Pearl, you can still battle in Pokétopia by collecting a Rental Pass at the front gate! A Rental Pass provides you with a random selection of six Pokémon to get you started and lets you save your progress as you advance. In multiplayer mode, there are plenty of battle options for you to explore. In Free Battle, friends who are in Pokétopia with Rental Passes can challenge each other, while DS Battle Mode allows up to four people to connect their DS to a Wii and import their Pokémon before doing battle. In DS Battle Mode, it’s even possible to control the action on your television by commanding your Pokémon on the DS Touch Screen. With this option activated, none of the commands shown on your DS will appear on the TV screen – leaving you and your friends to watch battles unfolding in all their cinematic glory!  Last, but by no means least, is the option to go online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and take on other Trainers from around the world. You can opt to battle random Trainers or challenge friends whose Friend Codes you have saved to a roster. You can save up to 60 friends to your roster, meaning you’ll never have to look far for a willing opponent!  Controlling the on-screen action couldn’t be easier. Apart from the option to use a Nintendo DS to control the action in DS Battle Mode, you have the choice of navigating through menus by pointing the Wii Remote at the screen and making selections with a cursor or holding the Wii Remote sideways and sorting through your options with the +Control Pad. Walking through the doors of Pokétopia is just the first step on a journey that will let you see your Pokémon in action like never before – as well as giving you the power to prove yourself one of the greatest Trainers on earth.

The expansive story is set during the largely unexplored era between Star Wars: Episode II Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. In it, players will assist the iconic villain in his quest to rid the universe of Jedi - and face decisions that could change the course of their destiny.
As its name implies, The Force Unleashed completely re-imagines the scope and scale of the Force by taking full advantage of newly developed technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time: Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), by Pixelux Entertainment, and euphoria by NaturalMotion Ltd. Paired with the powerful Havok Physics system, these new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consoles. DMM incorporates the physical properties of anything in the environment so that everything reacts exactly like it should - wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, plants on the planet Felucia bend like plants on the planet Felucia would, and more. Meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior on the fly and resulting in a different payoff every single time.

It's a one-of-a-kind platformer that lets players explore high and low for hidden objects and fun adventure.
Features:

The look of the world is stunning, but it's also interactive.  Pulling on stray threads might reveal hidden areas. When Kirby literally goes behind the scenes, the virtual fabric warps and bends to show his location.
Thanks to his versatile yarn composition, Kirby can take on a  variety of forms both in his common actions and when he transforms into powerful  vehicles. When Kirby dashes, he zips around as a car. In water, he turns into a submarine. At times he can even transform into a massive robotic tank, a UFO and other vehicles.
Two players can play through the entire game together (additional  accessories required and are sold separately). 
Gems and collectible items are scattered throughout the environments  for players to find.

As the satellite falls back to Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.
Sonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy it once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.
Meanwhile, as Robotnik begins repairing the Death Egg, he decides that Knuckles has served his purpose, and dispatches an EggRobo, a highly autonomous robot built in his own image, to dispose of Knuckles. He assumes that if EggRobo can't destroy Knuckles, his cover as the real mastermind won't be blown, leaving the possibility that Sonic and Knuckles may fight to the death. EggRobo's first assassination attempt - Dropping a bomb on a half-asleep Knuckles - only serves to enrage the echidna, setting him on a mission to stop both Sonic, and his mystery assailant. "

Players are now aware of their surroundings, reacting authentically to threats and opportunities to make intelligent decisions.

FIFA 08 now gives every football fan the chance to perform pro skills with a true next-generation organic ‘building-block’ system. You can combine tricks and skill moves together to recreate signature moves from the real-world superstars or define your own style of play. You can even capture video of your best moves and goals in-game and upload to the EA Sports Football World website to show off your style and celebrate your glory with friends across the globe.

The whole game is from a 3rd person perspective and your character levels and gains points into 5 attributes: Agility, Driving, Explosives, Strength and Firearms.  By using those different abilities effectively you gain experience and you are able to do a lot more. By the end of the game you'll be able to carry around huge trucks, jump over tall buildings and shoot people from very long distances like a superhero.The game shares a lot of aspects with the popular GTA series, you are free to do whatever you want, you don't necessarily have to go on missions constantly and playing the game and having fun with it is the main aim of Crackdown. On the other hand, the game really focuses on action and improves on the shooting and fighting aspects of GTA greatly, but takes away from a lot of the side amusements that GTA had. This makes this game a much more action packed, but also more shooter oriented. You move through three Islands in the game with each island representing a more difficult task to clean up and eliminate gang leaders. The main story is really just the player getting briefings about different mini bosses and bosses that control differnet aspects of a gang and that you eliminate to weaken the gang further. The strange thing about Crackdown is that you can go straight after the big bosses right from the start, but your odds of beating them are very low. So the player takes their time leveling their skills by using them in the huge city in different ways and eliminating smaller gang bosses to weaken certain aspects of a gang in order to allow for taking on the final gang leaders more easily.Crackdown features online co-op, racing minigames, stunts and possibly the most addictive collection aspect of any game in the form of blue and green orbs. The green orbs are placed in different locations at different heights and require you to figure out the best way to reach them and also to up your acrobatics skills, while the blue orbs are usually hidden ones and are more similar to the usual collecting in other games.Probably two things define this game other than that it is a sandbox game and it's an action 3rd person shooter and those are: the massive size of the world and the fact that a lot of the gameplay takes place vertically rather than horizontally. Every single building you see in the game, no matter how high and impossible to climb it seems, you can climb if you are skilled or experiences enough which really adds another fun aspect to the game.The graphics also stand out as it has a sort of cel shaded look and gives the game a kind of comic book feel that was probably the aim of the developers. This is a great example of the kind of game that gives you freedom to play around and do things the way you like it, the total opposite of a linear game.  "

220,1221,Cruis'n USA,cruisn-usa,Racing,E,N64,Nintendo,Midway Games,,,,1.72,0.0,,,,,1996.0,,http://www.vgchartz.com/game/430/cruisn-usa/?region=All,1,,/games/boxart/3900991ccc.jpg,1.72," 
Cruis'n USA, along with Killer Instinct, was to be one of the original games slated for release on the ""Ultra 64"" (the working title for the Nintendo 64). Nintendo also promised arcade-perfect translations of these titles. They delivered on neither count. Now, after years of wading through rumors and delays, the Nintendo 64 has made it to the store shelves, and so has Cruis'n USA. And while Nintendo's game machine lives up to its billing, Cruis'n USA doesn't even come close.
The dazzling qualities of Mario 64 and other banner-title N64 games make Cruis'n USA pale by comparison. Cruis'n USA's frame rate isn't up to speed, meaning that the movement is a touch jerky. Even so, the graphics are crisp and colorful, but the horizon is too close. The result is some pretty bad ""pop-up,"" where scenery simply fades away into the distance with little to no warning. The same tunes from the arcade version are present, but they come up short after being brutalized by the N64's weak music capabilities. The arcade's speech and sound effects are also present, though they're muffled.
The Nintendo 64's analog stick controller really comes into play during Cruis'n. After getting used to the feel of the stick, players should be able to take turns as though they were using the arcade version's steering wheel. Weaving in and out of oncoming traffic is no problem. Another nice feature is the addition of faster cars, each of which is earned by completing the entire 14-leg cross-country race. The game also includes hidden cars, most notably a school bus. But as much fun as driving a gray school bus may sound, it isn't a compelling reason to finish each difficulty level with each vehicle.
Ultimately, Cruis'n USA is a dead conversion of a dead arcade game. Perhaps if Nintendo had waited to release a home version of the planned sequel, Cruis'n World (like they did with KI Gold, an enhanced version of Killer Instinct 2), this effort may have been worthwhile
Ever felt like driving to the Golden Gate Bridge, Mount Rushmore and the White House in one day? Well then, gear up to put your racing skills to the test in a frantic trip across the United States, following a route that you won't find on any map. Whether it's the rolling hills of Appalachia, the flowing cornfields of Iowa or the crowded tunnels below Chicago, you'll find yourself too focused on the intense racing action to worry about the scenery.
Get started by picking from a garage full of cars to find the one that best suits your style—if you're good enough, you'll even find a few hidden ones to round out your selection. Then choose one of three different playing perspectives and get ready to hang on tight. With five difficulty levels, the ability to remove traffic or other racers, and two- player simultaneous racing, it's enough to make you forget all about finding that next rest stop. Just watch out for the cows, OK?

Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War is a game for the PlayStation 2 developed by Namco. It is a semi-realistic fighter pilot simulation. It is part of the Ace Combat series of games. In Europe and Australia this game was released under the title Ace Combat: Squadron Leader.
With the campaign mode the player takes on the role of the trainee Blaze of the Osea Air Defense Force (OADF). After a routine training mission that resulted in the death of two instructors and numerous trainees, Blaze is bumped up to being an active member of the Wardog squadron that includes Kei Nagase (Edge), Alvin Davenport (Chopper), and squad leader Jack Bartlett (Heartbreak One). Osea is subjected to strange recon activities by an unknown nation, believed to be the nearby Yuktobania, a massive superpower that matches Osea in military might. Tensions rise between Osea and Yuktobania, and the Wardog squadron is sent to investigate. Soon, The Union of Yuktobanian Republics declares war on the Osean Federation. But, this war was not instigated by Yuktobania, as is believed early in the game. The fallen nation of Belka (Squirrel in Russian), which was defeated by the allied forces of Osea and Yuktobania in The Belkan War of 1995, sought revenge and pitted the two nations against each other.
With the arcade mode the player takes on the role of Mobius 1 from Ace Combat 04 in a more fast-paced game with different missions and objectives than the campaign mode.

Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

*Game Introduction 
While it's officially a sequel to the immensely popular Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross is completely its own role-playing game with over 40 characters, a branching story line, and multiple endings. Like its predecessor, the game is about crossing through time and setting things right. This story focuses on Serge's quest for the Frozen Flame, which will give the beholder the power to bend space and time. Serge wants the power to save himself from dying in a parallel universe but, as you can guess, nefarious forces are also vying for the Frozen Flame to suit their own purposes.
Chrono Cross features the stylish character designs and wondrous cut scenes that gamers have come to expect from SquareSoft, but the game also has a number of gameplay innovations. Though the battle engine is essentially turn-based, characters don't have to wait their turn to cast a spell or make an attack; battles are moderated by stamina. Also, the repetitive battles with lesser monsters that make so many RPGs sag can be easily avoided because all monsters can be seen on the screen.

Long before Noah built his ark, the tales tell of an ancient land called Kiltia... a world where swords and sorcery reigned.
Its learning and power were swept away in the great flood, but one clue to its secrets remained: an ancient book known as the Gran Grimoire, hidden in darkness by the powers that once were.
It is not certain how many copies of the book still exist, but it is said that whoever should hold one holds the power to change the world.
Many lived out their days searching the world for surviving copies, but none were ever found.
It was an illusion, they said. A myth-but one worth dying for.
Our story begins soon after a young boy named Marche moves to the country town of St. Ivalice. Marche's family has had a difficult past, and it is all he can do to adjust to country life with the help of his new friends: Mewt, a mature but timid boy who often gets picked on, and Ritz, a stellar student whose strong-willed nature has made her unpopular at school.  They are friends, though they barely know more than each other's names.  But one day, the three of them come across an ancient magical book, and St. Ivalice changes forever...

A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force. When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader’s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival. Nariko must now pay the ultimate price as she embarks on one last mission of vengeance against the King and his army before her life is finally and irreparably overtaken by the omnipotent Heavenly Sword… Key Features The Heavenly Sword – The Heavenly Sword itself can transform into three distinct weapons, each with its own accompanying fighting stance used by Nariko to vary combat styles.The Combat Engine – The combat engine can scale up from sophisticated one-on-one encounters to one-on-many, where enemies employ intelligent squad-based dynamics, right up to combat against battalions pushing real-time gameplay and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to unprecedented new levels.Physics-Based Combat – The physics-based combat allows players to sweep debris against opponents, kick tables to halt an oncoming surge of fighters, smash the enemy into the scenery, or throw bodies into other enemies using “aftertouch” controls.Wide range of Objects & Weaponry – Heavenly Sword provides a wide range of objects & weaponry including rapid fire crossbows and massively damaging bazookas.Creative in-game Cinematography – Coupled with real-time story evolvement and amazing set-pieces, Heavenly Sword feels like a blockbuster action movie that takes combat gameplay to new heights.PLAYSTATION®3 – Greater processing power on the PS3 enables more immersive visuals and sound effects in Heavenly Sword, heightening the character performance and combat within the stunningly beautiful environments.Source - www.us.playstation.com "

Persona 5 is a game about the internal and external conflicts of a group of troubled high school students – the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets in the game’s story – who live dual lives as Phantom Thieves. They have the typically ordinary day-to-day of a Tokyo high schooler – attending class, after school activities and part-time jobs. But they also undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. Their power comes from the Persona, the Jungian concept of the “self;” the game’s heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective mask and confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and use it to strive to help those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the masks modern-day society wears.

Customize Your Ghost and Gear
Forget your uniforms and standard issue gear -- in Ghost Recon  Wildlands you’ll choose exactly what kind of special operative you want  to be. You’ll begin your journey in the Wildlands by deciding who you  are and picking the gear you want to bring into the field.
When creating your character, you’ll have the ability to customize your  gender, facial features, hairstyle, tattoos, and much more. You’ll gain  access to a wide range of clothing, tactical gear, and accessories to  give your Ghost a personalized look. You can hunt down the cartel in  full tactical gear or use civilian clothing if you prefer the style of  the Bolivian locals. With the ability to tweak every piece of your  outfit, and billions of available combinations, how you look is up to  you.


DECIDE HOW TO PLAY
CO-OP Group up with your friends anytime, anywhere, and play through the  entire game in 2-4 player online co-op. Jump in and out of online squads  whenever you choose, and you’ll always maintain your items, upgrades,  and story progression.
SOLO When playing solo you’ll have a team of 3 AI-controlled Ghosts  providing you backup. Give them orders and they’ll help you accomplish  your missions in whatever way you choose. When shifting from solo play  to co-op, you’ll bring all your single-player progress online.


Choose Your Loadout
As an elite squad with access to the latest military tech, the Ghosts  decide what weapons or tools to bring to the field. Choosing what guns  to add to your loadout will let you engage with your targets any way you  like. Whether you prefer to go unseen with long-range rifles and  silenced handguns, or break down the front door with assault rifles and  shotguns, the Ghosts’ true-to-life arsenal will give you the tools  you’ll need for the job.
And you’ll do more than simply choose your firearm – all firearms in the  game are fully customizable, allowing you to swap out attachments to  tweak various attributes of your weaponry. The in-game gunsmith allows  you to swap out optics, muzzles, magazines, stocks, and much more, all  of which will affect the performance of your weapon. You’ll be able to  tweak your firearm’s noise, accuracy, damage, rate of fire, range,  handling, and penetration, giving you total control over how you  approach your missions.
You’ll also customize the appearance of your weapons with camouflage and  paint options, giving you even more control over your operative’s  style.

The game takes on a much more action/shooter aspect as it leaves behind most of the jump from your seat moments for fast paced, adrenaline rush and challenging set combat situations.
Although different from the previous games in the series, this doesn't mean it is non sensically different as the story, feel and characters of the game are definitely in line with previous REs.
It's a 3rd person shooter with some timed events and melee combat added to it. The game really shows off on the graphical side. Definitely a challenging game that rewards precision and experience. Some of the best boss fights in any action game are to be encountered with everything from quick time events to trying to survive against capable and impressive bosses.
The story revolves around Leon Kennedy from RE 2 investigating the disappearence of the daughter of the president of the United States in rural Spain. Eventually, you discover that there are very bad things going on in the town and around it as you encounter both paranormal and downright weird enemies trying to end your game.
Definitely one of the funnest and best games of the last generation.
The game offered a limited edition controller, you could purchase through the instruction booklet. The gamecube also sold a limited edition Gamecube-RE4 packaged deal.

Diddy Kong Racing DS is the first hand-held adventure racing game, a genre that lets players visit new locations, talk to interesting characters, advance the storyline and search for hidden secrets – all while engaging other drivers in a series of racing challenges to see who is king of the road.Drivers can use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to go online and race against up to five other players from around the world.

Receiving a frantic plea for help, Diddy Kong assembles members of the Kong family and rushes to the rescue. Can he save the island in time, or will Wizpig hog all the glory for himself?How to progress through the game: Diddy Kong Racing DS is unique among racing games because it’s more than just a series of cups and challenges – it’s a full-fledged adventure. The game starts in a hub zone (a portion of the island that serves as an access point for all other areas), but where players go after that is up to them. They can drive over bridges, through oceans and around volcanoes as they enter races in a quest for balloons that let them unlock different portions of the island. And when they’re not racing, they can explore their surroundings and try to discover the many hidden secrets of Timber’s Island. But don’t think this is a leisurely Sunday drive – players have to speed through a huge variety of racing challenges if they want to complete the adventure and save their friends from Wizpig’s nefarious schemes.Characters: Diddy Kong, Pipsy, TipTup, Bumper, Timber, Crunch, Dixie Kong™ and Tiny Kong™ are all playable characters. Unlockable racers include Drumstick, TT, Taj and Wizpig himself.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: The game has 38 unique tracks, including four new tracks that were not in the N64 version. The tracks are contained in themed worlds such as Dino Domain, Snowflake Mountain and Future Fun Land. In the beginning, players will be able to race only on a couple of open tracks. To reach the others, they must explore the island, win races and uncover secrets that allow them to open doors and progress deeper into the game.Diddy Kong Racing DS features three different vehicle types: cars, hovercrafts and planes. And if players don’t like their current ride, they can now upgrade. In a new twist, Diddy Kong Racing DS allows players to upgrade their vehicles in the categories of speed, durability and appearance.No adventure racing game would be complete without a way to destroy foes, and Diddy Kong Racing DS gives players a massive arsenal at their disposal. Oil slicks, gas clouds, land mines, super shields, speed boosts, homing missiles, magnets … if players can’t work their enemies over, they aren’t trying. "

Two new cover stars will grace the packshot with multiple player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and England star Michael Owen endorsing the quality of PES 2008 by deciding to use their considerable talents alongside that of the game. As well as the outside having a new look, fans will be eager to know what new changes can be found inside the most important area of PES 2008 – the gameplay.  PES 2008 will feature a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It will learn counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use.  Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers will hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates will make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built. The next gen versions will also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely customise their PES 2008 experience.

“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""

In one level Bond is required to chase a criminal across a maze-like city while fighting off enemy thugs and avoiding civilian casualties. In another our hero finds himself swimming through an underwater submarine, advancing not only forward and backward, but up and down to as he descends deeper into the sunken structure's belly. Each scenario is not only different in design, but in overall gameplay mechanics too. For example, swimming through a sunken submarine requires a bit of strategy, as Bond will have to find well-hidden air pockets in the ship just so that he can breathe and stay alive. On the other hand, taking out enemy trash in the subway system level really only requires 007 to point, aim and shoot, disposing of thug after thug as he makes his way through the mission.   "

An extraordinary amusement park has been seen orbiting around the home planet of Sonic the Hedgehog, and rumors are spreading that an alien race of Wisps, who have a unique colorful energy, are being held captive there by the evil Dr. Eggman.  Soon after arriving at the amusement park, Sonic discovers he is able to use these mysterious alien forces to help the Wisps escape.

The alien Wisps featured in the game each have a unique Color Power that, once freed, Sonic is able to absorb while speeding through the various theme park inspired planets.  The Wisp energy enables Sonic to create new paths through the stages by drilling through the ground (Yellow Drill) for example, or speeding through the stage as a laser (Cyan Laser). Stringing the Wisp power-ups together creates a combo that increases Sonic’s boost gauge even more quickly. "

In Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell®: Pandora Tomorrow™, you play Sam Fisher, a cold-blooded stealth soldier waging a one-man war against an Indonesian terrorist network.




Believe the story: Inspired by the world of Tom Clancy, Pandora Tomorrow features a story line so real you can feel it. Tension-filled stealth action springs from a compelling and original plot that’s so realistic it could’ve been ripped from the headlines by scriptwriter JT Petty, who penned the original Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell.
Understand the characters: In this sequel, favorite characters like Sam Fisher and Irving Lambert return, unveiling even more about their personal histories in this character-driven story line. The cast of new antagonists includes the highly dangerous Suhadi Sodano, an Indonesian guerilla leader whose beliefs are sound, but whose methods are barbaric. And, then, there is Norman Soth, a CIA-trained mercenary. Is he deep under cover or a traitor working for the enemy? You’ll also encounter Douglas Shetland, the director of a private military corporation and an old acquaintance of Sam. And, there’s so much more to discover …
Immerse yourself: Revolutionary lighting, shadowing, animation, physics, and sound effects are pushed to the limit to create a universe so tightly woven that the line between reality and gaming starts to blur. High-resolution cinematics, amazing sound design, and top-quality voice-overs give Pandora Tomorrow a unique movie-production quality.
Show off your moves: Now, more than ever, Sam relies on his moves. In this sequel to the original Splinter Cell, circumstances demand that Sam use his agility and athleticism to avoid detection and death. In fact, the level design demands them. Use a half-split jump to reach a ledge. Zip line across an open courtyard. Grapple along the side of a building, and SWAT-turn to bypass open doors unseen.
Strap on the gear: Based on prototypes currently in development and gadgets out on the field, Sam Fisher’s high tech gadgets and tools will have you well-prepared for some intense stealth action.
Challenge your friends: Enjoy evolutionary multiplayer gameplay online.

While this game is a lot simpler than title such as Tiger Woods or even Hot Shots Golf it still has its fair share of different game mechanics.

There’s no one way to play Minecraft. It’s an  open-ended game where players decide what they want to do by themselves!  Minecraft offers several modes, though: Creative Mode, where players  are given limitless resources to build whatever they can imagine; and  Survival Mode, where players must explore the world and mine its  resources to feed, house and defend themselves. Or you can join your  friends online and make up your own rules!

Nearly every block in the world of  Minecraft can be  broken down by mining and collected. Then those bits  can be recombined  to build new stuff!Punch a tree until you get some wood, turn the wood  into planks and then combine the planks to create a crafting table. You  can use the crafting table to make all kinds of useful tools, so long as  you find the right ingredients.
Minecraft on Wii U supports split-screen play for up to four players and  comes with the Mario Mash-Up Pack. There are heaps of other cool things  for you to download, too, like console-only competitive modes, mini  games and more! Available as a physical disc or digitally from the  Nintendo eShop.

RE4 Wii Edition keeps all of the gameâ€™s incredible game systems intact. As Leon Kennedy, players will explore a town overrun by cultists, mutants and mind-controlled villagers, intuitiveily using the Wii Remote to aim, fire, slash and elude adversaries. RE4 Wii Edition will also contain the additional content included in the PlayStation 2 system version of the game. Gameplay:Resident Evil 4's game mechanics have been completely revamped to incorporate fast-paced gunplay, quick controls and shootouts involving massive crowds of enemies in large open areas. This, combined with an abundance of healing items and ammunition, results in a different gameplay experience from other Resident Evil games. Previous titles in the series have focused on exploration and conservation of ammunition - in RE4, the player can fire more ammunition and kill more enemies in one playthrough than in all of the other Resident Evil games combined (not including the Gun Survivor sub-franchise, in which the player is deliberately given infinite pistol ammunition). A typical play-through can result in the player killing upwards of 900 enemies. Also players have many more in game options to improve the experience.The intuitive Wii controls make this game the definitive Resident Evil 4 version. "

He didn't always have the macabre rhyming moniker; as a youngster, Red witnessed the slaughter of his entire family at the hands of ruthless Mexican general Diego and his posse of bloodthirsty bandits. After retrieving his father's trusty pistol from the flames that eviscerated his family home, Red honed his skills until he was ready to exact bloody revenge.
As the adult Red, it's your duty to lead the embittered cowboy through the dusty, tumbleweed-strewn towns and prairies of the Wild West and reduce its sizeable criminal population.
Red Dead Revolver comes bursting out of Rockstar's saloon doors with guns blazing. It's a third-person adventure that sees you dispensing hot lead justice to the hostile scumbags who want to see the vigilante living (or, rather, not living) up to his name.
Red's arsenal isn't limited to his six-shooter, either; over the course of his quest you'll find over 30 different armaments, including rifles, shotguns and dynamite. The drifter only has so many hands however, so you can only keep hold of one side arm, one long arm and one throwing weapon at a time. Pressing the R2 button will activate Red's 'Dead Eye' ability, which slows everything down to a crawl, giving him the chance to take out multiple enemies in what would otherwise be the blink of an eye.
The authentic Western flavour is capped off by the wide variety of environments; dust-towns populated by rickety wooden buildings, windswept prairies, dingy saloons... all the classic elements are present and correct. "

This year, THQ's Smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and the Playstation 3! In addition, PS2 and Xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. With many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ECW arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
Gameplay:SvR08 enables you take control of your favourite WWE superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. Thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. Submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  AI will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  In order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. What direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
Features:

Superstar Fighting Styles: With eight Superstar Fighting Styles to choose from, playing WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 will never be the same. Each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. Take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the Superstars.
Struggle Submission System: The new Struggle Submission System gives players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars using the analog sticks. Realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ECW Presence: The life of a WWE Superstar isn't always pretty. ECW invades WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 with a variety of Superstars, arenas and weapons.
WWE 24/7 Mode: Combining the popular Season and General Manager Modes from previous Smackdown vs. Raw games, WWE 24/7 Mode embraces the intensity of the Superstar lifestyle. Multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a Legend.
Giving Fans What They Want: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

The Federation believes Space Pirates may be behind the problem        and are soon attacked. Samus and other hunters leap to their defense        only to find that the enemy they face is Dark Samus, armed with immense        power that no one can withstand.

 First-Person Perfect: Players control Samus by moving with the Nunchuk          and aiming with the Wii Remote controller, allowing for a level of          immersion unlike anything they have ever experienced. It's a quantum          leap in first-person control. 
 Wonderful Weapons: Samus employs well-known power-ups like the Grapple          Beam and Morph Ball, as well as new surprises, to help her survive.

 Phazon's Powers: The game also incorporates a new system involving          Phazon. If you fill Samus' Phazon supply to a certain level, Samus          will temporarily go into hyper mode, a state in which she can pull off          incredible feats. On the flip side, if she exceeds the maximum Phazon          level, she'll perish. Also, for the first time in the Metroid series,          Samus' ship will be used in active game play.

This led to continued zombie outbreaks throughout the United States.
Dead Rising 2 shifts the action from the everyday world of mid-West America to the glitz and glamour of Fortune City, America’s latest and greatest entertainment playground. People flock to Fortune City from around the globe to escape from reality and the chance to win big.
The game sees the introduction of former national Motocross champion, Chuck Greene, as the main protagonist. Before he hit the big time with a team and sponsorship behind him Chuck was forced to repair his own bikes, leaving him incredibly resourceful; a real handyman. A single father, Chuck dotes on his daughter Katey who, since the loss of her mother, he will do anything for.
With hundreds of zombies on screen at any one time, the original Dead Rising forced gamers to turn the everyday objects they found in the Mall into improvised weapons capable of fending off attacks. Dead Rising 2 promises to increase the carnage with even more zombies intent on feasting on human flesh and countless new objects with which Chuck can make the undead dead. "

There are several different environments, ranging from a lava environment to the classic construction site, and there are five different types; in the first, and most common, Mario has to pick up a key and take it to the locked door. At the second part of the level, Mario had to pick up a Toy Mario at the end of the level. The second type is where Mario must guide the Mini Mario toys to the Toy Box, and protecting them from dangerous environments. The third type is the boss level, where Mario must fight Donkey Kong in order to proceed to the next world. The fourth type is the Master Boss, where Mario must throw barrels at Donkey Kong. The Plus game, which is a repeat of the Main game, is unlocked. In this mode, the story continues from the main game, where Donkey Kong obtains a new batch of Mini-Marios, but with their containers broken because DK fell from the roof, into the truck. In each plus level, Mario must activate a Mini-Mario in the level, which is holding a key, and take it to the door. The fifth type of level is the Expert levels. In this mode, Mario must get close to the Mini-Mario with the key and lead it to the door in a very hard level.

In response, the North Korean government initiates secret overtures to Russia, who strikes a quiet alliance.

Having        traded her haunted past for the solitary life of a bounty hunter, Samus        finally tells her own tale in this revealing, personal story of her        failings, her flaws and ultimately her motivation. Metroid: Other M is an unprecedented collaboration that blends the slick, action-packed        production of the world-renowned Team Ninja development team with the        game design talents of the creators of the original Metroid. Metroid:        Other M is a dramatic new direction for a legendary franchise and a        bold new blend between cinematics, storytelling and the best in        interactive entertainment.

 Metroid: Other M takes the best elements of 1st-person and          3rd-person gaming to create a seamless blend between gameplay,          story-telling and dynamic cinematography, that feels like a movie the          player can control.Players hold the Wii Remote controller sideways          while navigating and battling in 3rd-person. However, at any moment,          players can switch immediately to Wii Remote pointer controls to          examine and explore the environments in 1st-person perspective. 
 Metroid fans know more about Samus’ suits and weapons than they          do about what drives her. That’s about to change. The story begins          immediately following the events of Super Metroid, when a baby          Metroid gave its life to protect Samus. With voice acting and a rich          story, players learn the engaging backstory of Samus as she weaves          through an action-packed adventure aboard the Bottle Ship, a          decommissioned space facility. As she hurtles into this new adventure,          Samus will encounter her first mentor and Commanding Officer of the          Galactic Federation, Adam Malkovich. 
 The development of Metroid: Other M is an exciting          collaboration between Nintendo’s Yoshio Sakamoto and Team Ninja.          Sakamoto was the director of Super Metroid in 1994. Team Ninja          is the renowned action developer of Ninja Gaiden. Metroid:          Other M pairs Sakamoto’s expert level design and exploratory focus          of the classic Metroid series with Team Ninja’s signature stylish,          no-holds-barred action.

In this long-awaited exclusive Xbox 360 title, fill the shoes of one Alan Wake, a man who makes his living from the terror of others as a best-selling suspense novelist. Trapped in the deceptively peaceful Washington town of Bright Falls, where he came to escape the trauma of losing his fiancée, Alan must piece together a mystery to prevent himself from being trapped inside a nightmarish world forever.
An intense psychological thriller from Remedy, the creators of Max Payne, Alan Wake looks to raise the bar for future games, creating a true cinematic experience. Explore an expansive world filled with missions, unique puzzles, intense combat, and horrifying enemies. Dig into a twisting and multi-layered story filled with suspense, engaging characters, and shocking revelations.




Episodic content: The mission-based structure of Alan Wake creates an episodic narrative similar to the very best of dramatic television. As the episodes progress, gameplay evolves to introduce new elements and characters, drawing the player deeper into the experience.
Realistic environment: Experience an immersive reality like never before, as weather and light changes affect gameplay. Explore every aspect of a hyper-detailed Pacific Northwest town as you look for the truth behind the horror around you.
Massive world: Explore and roam free in an open environment as you investigate the mysteries of Bright Falls. Pay close attention to detail as you look for clues scattered through the town.
Brutal combat: As night falls, creatures begin to attack, and the longer Alan spends in Bright Falls, the longer the nights get. His enemies seem to draw their power from the darkness, and light soon becomes his greatest ally. Combine use of light with more conventional weapons to drive back the forces that hide in the dark.




ringing a new style of storytelling to Xbox 360, “Alan Wake” is a psychological action thriller from Remedy, the renowned developers of the successful “Max Payne” series. In this dynamic new title exclusively for Xbox 360, players assume the role of Alan Wake, a best-selling suspense author suffering from writer’s block, who escapes to a small town only to experience the mysterious disappearance of his fiancée.
 
Set in the deceptively idyllic town of Bright Falls, Wash., “Alan Wake” immerses players in an intense and expansive cinematic world that enables players to explore the hyper-realistic and interactive environments. “Alan Wake” is mission-based with a deeply engaging and suspenseful storyline unveiling new twists and profound character revelations at every turn.
 
Players will unravel the riveting plot through multilayered character interactions, unique problem-solving and intense combat against terrifying enemies. In this nightmarish world, where fantasy and reality collide, Alan Wake must use a variety of weapons to survive, including his most powerful ally against the darkness — light itself.
 
Features:                            ·     Intense psychological thriller. “Alan Wake” delivers a deeply
psychological and finely crafted plot that raises the bar for storytelling in video games. The riveting story of “Alan Wake” is propelled by a movie-like atmosphere, compelling situations, memorable characters and real-time pacing. Remedy has a record of creating and developing games with unique cinematic presentation and exceptionally high production values.

Light as a combat element. As Wake journeys deeper into the mystery of Bright Falls, the shadows close in around him. When darkness descends, light becomes his only ally as he fights his way to daybreak. . This poses a severe problem for Alan Wake since his enemies seemingly gain strength from the shadows, and before long, light itself becomes his greatest ally. Players must skillfully combine their use of light with more conventional weapons to stand a chance.
Realistic, interactive environment. Set in the town of Bright Falls, the hyper-detailed environments of the Pacific Northwest play an important role; even the change in daylight and weather will profoundly affect the characters and enemies in “Alan Wake.” The game’s advanced rendering engine provides amazingly realistic environments that bring this world to detailed life — from the lush forest of evergreen trees to the quaint small-town buildings and streets. The world of “Alan Wake” is alive and real.
Episodic narrative. The mission-based structure of “Alan Wake” creates an episodic narrative similar to a deeply structured dramatic television series, such as Twin Peak and X-Files. As the episodes progress, gameplay will evolve to introduce new elements and characters, escalating the level of threat and action in the game.

• Pit is unable to fly on his own, but upon receiving the “Power of Flight” from Palutena, he can soar swiftly through the skies for about five minutes at a time. After each stage’s initial air battle, Pit enters into ground-based skirmishes.
• While Pit is battling in the air, the action unfolds like a dynamic guided shooter. Yet when he’s facing enemies on land, it handles like a third-person shooter. Throughout the sprawling adventure, players gather numerous distinctive weapons and collect treasures.
• Beyond the deep single-player adventure, Kid Icarus: Uprising also offers a thrilling and unique take on multiplayer battles. Two teams battle against each other, whittling away their point totals as each team member is defeated. When one team loses all its points, the last member defeated is revived as the powerful Angel Pit. If the other team can track him down and defeat him, they will win the match, introducing a new ebb-and-flow dynamic to multiplayer battles.
• The game includes AR Card compatibility. Using the built-in 3D camera on the Nintendo 3DS system, the game recognizes countless specially designed AR Cards, with animated game characters popping up in 3D on the game screen and even battling each other when two cards face off.
• The game’s simple, intuitive play control has players hold the system in their left hand, while the right hand uses the stylus on the touch screen for targeting. Their left thumb on the Circle Pad controls Pit’s movements, and the L Button fires ranged weapons and unleashes melee attacks. The controls are simple enough to be grasped quickly, but offer layers of depth and strategy for advanced maneuvers. A special control option for left-handed players is also being prepared.   Take Aim at a Timeless Adventure. Some 25 years after the original Kid Icarus™ game for NES™ captured the hearts and imaginations of gamers worldwide, Kid Icarus™: Uprising brings the action and adventure of this beloved series to new heights – and new visual dimensions – on the Nintendo 3DS™ system. The dark goddess Medusa and her Underworld Army have returned, and they’ve got their sights set on the heroic angel Pit. With the aid of Palutena, goddess of light and guardian of the human race, Pit must fend off this malevolent threat. The richly immersive graphics of the Nintendo 3DS system offer incredible depth as Pit battles enemies by air and by land.

The war spills over onto a new patch: the Nintendo DS. The long-running Grand Theft Auto franchise debuts on the DS with Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.
A new entry into the Grand Theft Auto series and a Nintendo DS exclusive, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars was built from the ground up for Nintendo DS. It’s the story of Huang Lee, a spoilt, wealthy member of the Chinese Triad crime syndicate. Huang arrives in Liberty City after the untimely assassination of his father in Hong Kong to deliver the ‘Yu Jian’, a family heirloom, to his power-crazy uncle, Wu ‘Kenny’ Lee. The ‘Yu Jian’ is a sword that’s been a false symbol of honour, with its history and value draped in lies.
But once Huang arrives, he’s ambushed by a car full of gunmen - shot, robbed and left for dead, dumped into the Humboldt River. He barely survives, but the ‘Yu Jian’ is stolen. Huang must retrieve the sword for his uncle and take down those who wanted him to sleep with the fishes.
This is a full-fledged Grand Theft Auto experience. As Huang, you’ll explore a massive, modern iteration of Liberty City. The world of Chinatown Wars is among the biggest, richest and most detailed gaming environments on Nintendo DS. The 3D city is shown from an overhead, angled perspective using a camera that rotates 360 degrees. As they move through the city. the player can see each and every side of all the cars and buildings, giving the environment more of an isometric feel.
In Liberty City, you’ll find a large assortment of vehicles such as cars, trucks, vans, buses, boats and motorcycles. When you drive some of the vehicles, you can perform special side-missions, such as taxi missions, fire-fighter missions, paramedic missions, vigilante missions, and food delivery missions.
To learn about the newest missions and more, Huang has a handy PDA, the main hub of communication and access to game menus. On his PDA, Huang receives emails and messages from characters as well as special offers from online retailers like Ammunation that can deliver the finest custom-ordered guns and ammunition straight to his home. The PDA can also serve as a music player, a contacts database and a resource for all current trade information surrounding the in-game economy.
The PDA is also equipped with a full-featured GPS map. Seen on the bottom screen of the DS when you’re driving or on foot, the GPS map details key points of interest and mission objectives. Players can tap any intersection to set a course for the shortest legal route to any destination - which will change dynamically should the player veer off course. Other key points of interest, once you discover them, will also be added to the map, such as Pay N Sprays, Gas Stations, Safehouses, Odd Jobs, Random Encounters, Rampages, Street Races, Unique Stunt Jumps and more.
The police are friends to most citizens. Unfortunately for Huang, he’s unique. However, your demolition skills can get Huang out of hot water. The Chinatown Wars police-evasion system delivers a fun and frantic arcade-like action experience because instead of evading different levels of police radar on the map, players are now smashing, crashing and ramming cruisers at full speed to disable them. The more cars the player disables, the lower Huang’s Wanted level falls. The objective, however, isn’t to completely destroy the police vehicles because if the player harms the policemen inside, the Wanted level will only increase as a result.
What would a Nintendo DS game be without cool Touch Screen controls? Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is no different. You’ll use the Touch Screen for such activities as bursting out of submerged vehicles, hotwiring cars, preparing Molotov cocktails at the gas station, digging through trash bins for hidden weapons and tattooing.
Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is not for the kids, as the subject matter is for mature audiences. But for those old enough to get their hands on the game, this is a DS title that raises the bar in terms of both style and substance.

Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars also utilises Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players can upload game stats, send messages to friends and exchange items. Further details about the game’s Wi-Fi capabilities and multiplayer modes will be announced soon.
Experience changing weather effects and a 24-hour day/night cycle.
Pedestrians feature advanced A.I. that allows them to head out of the doors of their homes, about town in their cars and back home again. Some may stop to talk to each other, get into arguments, walk in and out of shops, use food stands and more.

732,1733,WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008,wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2008,Fighting,T,PS3,THQ,Yuke's Media Creations,,7.3,,0.0,1.33,0.62,0.5,0.01,0.2,2007.0,,http://www.vgchartz.com/game/12783/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2008/?region=All,1,,/games/boxart/6305625ccc.jpg,1.33,"
This year, THQ's Smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and the Playstation 3! In addition, PS2 and Xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. With many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ECW arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
Gameplay:SvR08 enables you take control of your favourite WWE superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. Thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. Submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  AI will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  In order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. What direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
Features:

Superstar Fighting Styles: With eight Superstar Fighting Styles to choose from, playing WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 will never be the same. Each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. Take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the Superstars.
Struggle Submission System: The new Struggle Submission System gives players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars using the analog sticks. Realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ECW Presence: The life of a WWE Superstar isn't always pretty. ECW invades WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 with a variety of Superstars, arenas and weapons.
WWE 24/7 Mode: Combining the popular Season and General Manager Modes from previous Smackdown vs. Raw games, WWE 24/7 Mode embraces the intensity of the Superstar lifestyle. Multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a Legend.
Giving Fans What They Want: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

In Petz Wild Animals Dolphinz for Nintendo DS™, you'll care        for dolphins, killer whales, penguins, and more in an exciting aquatic        park and marine sanctuary.
Rescue endangered animals and save their aquatic home. Keep your animals        healthy, happy, and well trained, and more friends of nature will visit        your park. The more visitors, the more resources you have to pamper your        animals and transform your park into an all-star attraction.

 Learn to take care of the different animals (dolphins, killer whales,          penguins, pink flamingos…) and also help to develop the sanctuary and          make it larger so that it can welcome even more endangered animals. 
 The animals need a lot of attention: they need to be fed, taken care          of, entertained and trained, in order to get them to amaze audiences          with their special tricks. 
 If the animals are happy and healthy, more and more friends of nature          will come visit the park and support your efforts. 
 Each animal has an identity card which summarizes its qualities and          what it needs. Some animals of the same species have different          personalities or different colors. The baby animals are often much          more fragile. 
 With the money you make, you must renovate the park, maintain the          tanks and improve the equipment. Try to make the park as beautiful          possible. 
 Dolphinz enables you to get close to animals and their way of life,          but it also lets you learn about the history of the marine Sanctuary,          which is menaced by an unscrupulous multinational corporation. You          have to save the park so that it can continue to protect the          endangered marine species. 
 To get a good look at everything, check out your park from the sky          and, whenever you want, go down into the tanks to take care of the          animals close up. 
 Throughout your adventures, you will meet different characters: a          veterinarian, a life-guard, a scientist, a sailor….. they’ll help you          carry out your missions and save the park. 
 Thanks to wireless connections, you will be able to invite your          friends to your park to check out your animals.

The year is 2025. The optimism and harmony of the 2010s were completely eradicated by 2020. A global crisis loomed. Food shortages sparked riots, currencies plummeted, fuel reserves dwindled, and oil-producing nations began to ration what remained. It is a dark future. Governments earmarked money for humanitarian efforts, overseas security, and intelligence services which, over time, found its way the coffers of a small group of Private Military Companies (PMCs). These three private armies (Valor, Raven, and S.V.E.R.) then began to recruit aggressively. Soldiers without a country, the contractors fight wars that never happened. This is the nature of the Shadow War.
 
From the award-winning developer, Zipper Interactive, comes the next evolution in gaming: MAG. A first-person, online-only shooter, MAG lets you experience battles with up to 256 real people across a global battlefield. Players join one of three PMCs fighting each other in a shadow war and can either become skilled operatives or rank up to eventually command their private army to victory. Featuring unprecedented online action of a scale never before devised with player controlled strategic assets such as calling in air strikes, mortar barrages, and parachute insertions; the persistent Shadow War in MAG keeps players coming back for more.
 
Utilizing a sophisticated ranking system and chain of command model, MAG manages the large number of players by breaking them down into squads of eight players. Players climb their way up the chain of command to take control of their 8-person squad, then 32-person platoon, and ultimately a 128-person army.
 
KEY FEATURES    
 

Unprecedented Action – For the first time ever, fight 256 real player battles in hi-def online combat for contracts around the world.
Command Structure – Rise through the chain of command, earning the right to lead an eight-man squad, 32-man platoon, and even command a full 128-man army.
Persistent Shadow War – Each battle victory or loss contributes to your PMC’s world standing, moving it on the offensive or pulling it back to the defensive.
Choose an army – Three distinct PMCs from which to choose from, each with their own storied history, personality, and style.
Customization – Customize your character and begin to pursue a wide variety of combat specialties.  Become an elite fighter or a general of an army.

This...may be our last chance.
Final Fantasy X
The world lies on the brink of destruction. Only a select few may be able to save it. 
In ages past, the world of Spira experienced a golden  age of  perfection, brought about by an advanced civilization through the  use  of wondrous machinery called machina..
However, around one thousand years before the present day, a   colossal menace known only as ""Sin"" appeared and sundered all before it.   Though a line of summoners have since brought Sin low many times, 				 		it inevitably returns in an unending cycle of destruction. In the   face of this ever-pervasive threat, the people of Spira flocked to the   teachings of Yevon, which tell that Sin is a punishment to 						those  who relied overly on machina.
Tidus is a young Blitzball star that mysteriously finds himself  in  Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin one  thousand  years in the past. Believing Sin to be the key to returning  home,  Tidus joins a young summoner named Yuna on her pilgrimage to  destroy  Sin and bring about the Calm.
Final Fantasy X-2
Last time she saved the world. This time its personal!
Two years have passed since Sin was destroyed. Since  her victory  and becoming a high summoner, Yuna has lived on her  childhood home of  Besaid Island. Then one day, Rikku comes to Besaid and  shows Yuna a  sphere. 						The recording is of him. Or is it?
Yuna can't tell whether it's him or just someone who looks like  him.  If it is him, Yuna might be able to see him one more time. No  matter  what the truth may be, the answers she finds may change things  forever.

THE AUTHORITY IN WWE VIDEO GAMES RETURNS WITH WWE 2K16!
The newest addition to the flagship WWE franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new WWE Superstars, Divas and Legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
Features 
•Largest Roster Ever: Offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin alongside Seth Rollins, Daniel Bryan, Dean Ambrose, Bad News Barrett, Paige and Finn Bálor, WWE 2K16 includes the largest roster in WWE games history
-The roster contains an unprecedented combination of current WWE Superstars and Divas, emerging NXT talent, WWE Hall of Famers and WWE alumni from multiple eras
•Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator: Fans who pre-order WWE 2K16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator:
-T-800 from The Terminator and T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
•2K Showcase: The franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in WWE 2K16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in WWE history. Along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•MyCareer: The franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from NXT to WWE to earn a spot in the WWE Hall of Fame. In addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•Creation Suite: Building on last year’s foundation, WWE 2K16’s Creation Suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including Create a Diva, Create a Championship, Create an Arena, and Create a Show. Key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including Create a Superstar, Create an Entrance, Superstar Studio and Community Creations.
•WWE Universe: WWE 2K16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. In addition, for the first time, Superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•Online: Completely overhauled based on fan feedback, WWE 2K16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the WWE Games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•Soundtrack: Players can customize their in-game music through the addition of Superstar entrance music to the WWE 2K16 Jukebox. Additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•Gameplay Improvements: WWE 2K16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest WWE gameplay experience to date:
-Improved Controls: The controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. This change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. WWE 2K16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. Opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-New Reversal System: The reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  Each Superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces Major and Minor reversals for select moves. Minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. Major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. Successful Major Reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-New Pin System: The new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. If the opponent kicks out, a Superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. In addition, WWE 2K16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. Dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. There is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. Rope Breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. In line with WWE live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-Chain Wrestling: New positions and attributes allow players to distinguish Superstars from one other. There can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-Working Holds: Working holds are new for WWE 2K16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. Just like on WWE programming, Working Holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-Improved AI: WWE 2K16 sees big improvements to the AI for Superstars, referees and managers. For example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. In addition, significant changes are included for match-specific AI, including Tag Team matches.
-More Match Types: Many match types of been added for WWE 2K16, including Ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-Dynamic Entrances: With the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their Superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. Why wait for the bell? In WWE 2K16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•Additional Improvements: WWE 2K16 also includes an improved Submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•Overall Enhancements: WWE 2K16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-New Commentary Team: For the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with John “Bradshaw” Layfield, new to WWE 2K16 joining returning commentators Michael Cole and Jerry “The King” Lawler. Thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-Visual Upgrades: This year’s title features several thousand new animations. WWE Superstar and Diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. Improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-Broadcast Presentation: Gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. Significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

Developed under Codemasters’ exclusive worldwide agreement with   Formula One World Championship Limited, F1 2011 will come complete with   all the official drivers, teams and circuits featuring in the 2011 FIA   FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™.
With a new focus on multiplayer gaming, including co-op Championships   and split-screen mode, F1 2011 will invite players to ‘Be The Driver,   Live the Life, Go Compete’ with a range of innovations, improvements  and  enhancements on and off the track. Set to be the most enthralling   season yet, the 2011 FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP features two new   circuits in India and Germany, new drivers, rules, tyres as Sebastian   Vettel seeks to defend his title.
Developed using Codemasters’ EGO Game Technology Platform F1 2011  will  deliver an unrivalled FORMULA ONE experience that puts players  into the  heart of the world’s most exciting sport, powered by cutting  edge  graphics, advanced physics systems and integrated network play.
• Go Compete! F1 2011 builds extensively on the multiplayer options  from  F1 2010. Split-screen racing is included for the first time in a   high-definition FORMULA ONE title. Competitive online racing is extended   with 16 players going head-to-head in GRAND PRIX™ with up to 8 AI   drivers added to simulate the full grid of 24 drivers. An innovative new   co-op Championship enables two players to lead their favourite FORMULA   ONE team to Driver and Constructor glory across the course of a  FORMULA  ONE season. These enhancements are complimented by additional  quick fire  modes including Time Attack.
• New Circuits for 2011. Two stunning new additions to the race  calendar  extend the number of circuits to feature in F1 2011 to 19.  Players will  be able to debut ahead of the drivers on the Buddh  International  Circuit, the home of the first FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF  INDIA and players  will be able to test themselves on the iconic  Nürburging circuit for  the first time in High Definition, as this  legendary track returns for  the 2011 season.
• Be the driver, live the life. From the paddock to the track, F1  2011  takes players closer to the experience of being a FORMULA ONE  driver  than ever before. A new Parc Ferme area, an expanded and  revamped  Paddock, new Pit Lane, celebration and reaction cinematics and  an  enhanced media interaction system fully immerse players in the  glamour,  pressure and excitement of being a FORMULA ONE driver. Players  progress  from rookie to FIA FORMULA ONE DRIVERS’ WORLD CHAMPION in an  extensive  career mode where gamers fight to become priority driver and  shape the  development of the car by performing well in races and  earning  performance upgrades.

• KERS, DRS and more! F1 2011 includes all the new rule changes set  to  make this year’s season the most exciting yet. F1 2011 debuts DRS  (Drag  Reduction System) � the new system which enables drivers to  adjust the  rear wing on the car to give a boost of up to 10km. KERS  also returns,  giving players an extra 80BHP for up to 6.67 seconds,  enabling drivers  to blast past rivals. Combined, these systems  encourage close  wheel-to-wheel racing with new options for both defence  and attack. This  season’s new Pirelli tyres are faithfully simulated  in the game, and if  players push their car too hard they may experience  a range of  authentic new damage failures.
• Full Day / Night Racing. The 2011 FORMULA 1 ETHIAD AIRWAYS ABU  DHABI  GRAND PRIX comes alive with a full day/ night transition which  recreates  the special atmosphere at this unique track. Every one of the  existing  circuits from the 2010 roster has been given a complete  visual overhaul.  New atmospheric effects, including dynamic clouds,  compliment a weather  system which features an advanced rain model that  affects on-track  grip. Powered by the EGO Game Technology Platforms, F1  2011 pushes  forward the graphical standard of what can be achieved in a  racing game.
• The world’s greatest cars, the most exciting racing. Building on  the  heritage of producing award-winning racing games for over a decade,   Codemasters is uniquely placed to realise the spectacle and  exhilaration  of racing 200MPH+ FORMULA ONE cars for all fans.

A huge range of  vehicle variables can be tuned  to suit each player’s unique driving  style, or drivers can entrust their  Race Engineer to set their car up  and head straight onto the track. F1  2011 will support a comprehensive  range of racing wheels for the  ultimate racing experience.
• Unprecedented authenticity. Codemasters has used its unprecedented   access to the world of FORMULA ONE to connect the development team   directly with FORMULA ONE teams and tyre manufacturers. Extensive   consultancy has taken place with a range of FORMULA ONE professionals,   including race engineers, mechanics and drivers. This has been combined   with real world data including CAD and on-board telemetry to deliver a   race experience complete with authentic handling, accurate circuits and   precisely modelled racing cars.
• EGO powered FORMULA ONE. F1 2011 is being developed on the EGO Game   Technology platform, evolved from the award winning EGO engine.  Enabling  Codemasters development talent to share tools and technology  across  Studios and Central Technology teams, the EGO Game Technology  Platform  empowers Codemasters game designers to realise their creative  visions  across multiple platforms featuring cutting edge graphics,  powerful AI,  advanced physics systems and integrated network play.

Four elemental Crystals, each possessing awesome power, lie scattered throughout the realm. However, men are quick to covet things which offer strength, and easily corrupted by the might which they possess...

The dark knight Cecil – Lord Captain of Baron’s elite force, the Red Wings – is ordered by his king to obtain the Crystals, but soon begins to question the monarch's motives. Stricken with grief at his own actions, yet burdened by his loyalty to his country and his personal sense of honor, Cecil at last decides to turn from the path of darkness and destruction.
 
Enraged, the king accuses him of disloyalty, strips Cecil of his command, and sends him off to slay a mysterious beast that lurks in the nearby Valley of Mist. Cecil embarks on a fateful journey that will bring trials, betrayals, friendship, loss and self-discovery. Can Cecil open his eyes and become the man of honor that he must be?

This year, THQ's Smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and the Playstation 3! In addition, PS2 and Xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. With many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ECW arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
Gameplay:SvR08 enables you take control of your favourite WWE superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. Thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. Submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  AI will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  In order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. What direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
Features:

Superstar Fighting Styles: With eight Superstar Fighting Styles to choose from, playing WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 will never be the same. Each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. Take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the Superstars.
Struggle Submission System: The new Struggle Submission System gives players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars using the analog sticks. Realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ECW Presence: The life of a WWE Superstar isn't always pretty. ECW invades WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 with a variety of Superstars, arenas and weapons.
WWE 24/7 Mode: Combining the popular Season and General Manager Modes from previous Smackdown vs. Raw games, WWE 24/7 Mode embraces the intensity of the Superstar lifestyle. Multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a Legend.
Giving Fans What They Want: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!
