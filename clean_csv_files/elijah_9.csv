There's more happiness to spread, and Chibi-Robo is just the robot to do        it!
A pollution epidemic is transforming the local park into a contaminated        wasteland. It's up to Chibi-Robo to return the park to its former glory        and defeat Sergeant Smogglor, champion of all things toxic and gross.        With his trusty squirter and boom box in hand, Chibi must raise flowers,        defeat noxious Smoglings and save the world.
 

 Touch controls let players interact with the world in new ways. Slide          the stylus with good timing to squirt enemies, water flowers, pedal a          bike and blast a boom box. 
 Chibi's mission is bigger than ever this time around. Instead of          living in a single home with one family, Chibi's on his own in the          park now, spreading happiness to an entire town. The screen might be          smaller, but the world is much bigger. 
 As Chibi progresses in this green adventure, he'll meet all sorts of          colorful characters, like marionette Francois, football mascot Bull          and soda ""spokesanimals"" Pop and Fizz. If Chibi befriends these toys,          they will help him in his quest to fix the park. 

Characters: One of the focuses of this game is developing        relationships with other toys, who, once befriended, give players Happy        Points and help them with their park projects. These colorful characters        include:

 Pop and Fizz: The penguin ""spokesanimals"" for PopFizz Soda. 
 Francois: A marionette on a mission to escape his strings. 
 Bull: A sports mascot who doesn't want to hang up his cleats yet. 
 Molly Mapleleaf: A plastic toy who dreams of becoming a real tree. 
 Tampa: A Free Ranger in search of a career change. 
 Chassy: A classic car who wants to avoid the junkyard. 

Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Chibi has a host of tools        at his disposal. His trusty squirter does double duty as a gardening        tool and an anti-Smogling weapon, while his boom box provides the tunes        for him to dance to and helps sprout flower seeds. Chibi also has a        variety of vehicles that he can use to travel around the town and park,        including a cart, a canoe and a bicycle.

For love, they sailed the world. For family, they made the greatest sacrifices. For honor, they stood and faced the will of gods and fought a war that shook the earth...
 
In the age when Zeus Almighty ruled over immortals and men, what begins as a truce between two cities quickly erupts into a massive war that will shake the very foundations of Olympus.
Two great armies clash not over home and country, but for the love of a single woman. The fates of these civilizations now stand upon the razor's edge.

FEATURES

Do battle as the Trojans or the Greeks. With two unique storylines, players will see the war from two perspectives.
Clash with legions of soldiers on glorious battlegrounds that reach for miles
Do whatever you must to survive in battle. Grab a sword from a fallen enemy and hurl it at a soldier bearing down on you. Smash an opponent with your shield, and then run your spear through him. Or, if you're strong enough, just throttle them with your bare hands.
Battle larger-than-life heroes and even confront mythical creatures sent by the gods themselves.
Among the inspirations for the game are The Iliad, Homer’s epic poem from the 9th century BC, and in-depth research of the ancient battlefields of the Trojan War.

Blood Omen 2, the latest installment in the Legacy of Kain Series is a 3rd person 3D action/combat game in which the player assumes the role of the vampire Kain. A compelling story drives the player through huge lushly detailed 3D environments and challenges their game play skills in combat, puzzle solving, stealth and exploration. With each success, the player achieves new dark powers that will grant Kain the ability to access treacherous new areas to explore and the power to face stronger, more aggressive enemies. As the player develops a stronger, more skilled vampire, they are rewarded with dozens of dazzling in-game cinematic sequences that unfold the continuing epic of Nosgoth, and Kain's attempts to ultimately rule over it.

Features:

You are the vampire Kain - the most evil figure to grace a video game console.

Combat choreography unfolds with dance-like precision as Kain engages armies of demons and humans alike.


The comprehensive menu of unstoppable attacks, nimble combos, and special moves will satiate even the hardened of fighting game fans.


The most beautiful graphics seen on a console to date! The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed, blood-chilling gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon to be dead.

The combination of a dynamic action game with the dark mood and atmosphere make for an intense and cinematic gaming experience.

For the first time, gamers will experience the full complexity and exciting challenge of Quidditch, which involves two teams of seven players who fly on broomsticks, playing four balls simultaneously. Players will control every position on their team, including three Chasers who try to score with the Quaffle™, two Beaters who control the dangerous Bludgers, the Keeper who protects the goal, and the Seeker who chases the elusive Golden Snitch™ that must be caught to end the match.  Starting with any one of the four Hogwarts™ House teams-including Harry Potter's Gryffindor™-players learn Quidditch basics with five original challenges and the Hogwarts House Cup competition. Once completed, players can enter the international World Cup tournament, choosing from a range of international teams including the USA, Bulgaria featuring Victor Krum, the hard-hitting Nordics, England, Japan, Germany, France, and Australia. Each national team sports its own Quidditch gear, has a unique stadium environment, and different strengths that lend depth and strategy, especially when two gamers face off for the first-ever Harry Potter multiplayer competition.  The Quidditch World Cup tournament progresses through a unique ladder system where players must defeat the team ranked above them by a variable amount of points, making the choice of when to go after the Golden Snitch a tactical one-capture it before amassing enough points to advance up the ladder and you may win the match but lose a chance to advance.

Developed under Codemasters’ exclusive worldwide agreement with    Formula One World Championship Limited, F1 2011 will come complete  with   all the official drivers, teams and circuits featuring in the  2011 FIA   FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™.
With a new focus on multiplayer gaming, including co-op Championships    and split-screen mode, F1 2011 will invite players to ‘Be The Driver,    Live the Life, Go Compete’ with a range of innovations, improvements   and  enhancements on and off the track.

Ty, raised by a pack of bilbies, has only vague memories of his family and friends and believes that he is the lone remaining Tasmanian Tiger. During a chance meeting with a mystical elder, Ty discovers that his fellow Tasmanian Tigers are still alive but trapped in another world -- Dreamtime.   Ty must find five stolen talismans that will unlock and open the Dreamtime portal that is located deep within the Australian Outback. If successful, Ty will be able to free his family and reunite with them. So begins Ty’s adventurous journey where he traverses through a wide range of locations including the rainforest, snowy mountains, desert terrain and a barrier reef. Along the way, he will encounter a large cast of characters -- both friends and foes -- all of which are based on real-life animals that are indigenous to the Australian Outback. For example, the lovable Ty is inspired by the extinct Tasmanian Tiger and the evil Boss Cass -- who along with his minions presents obstacles that Ty must overcome – is a cassowary.

Time has passed since the 'Rise of the Fungi' and indeed the Amanita and Lepiota societies have brought war to the peaceful Bolete and Morel mushroom tribes. Some among the Mushroom Men believe that the secret to winning the Spore Wars lies in uncovering the facts about the Mushroom's origins. As the Myth states, the mushroom who discovers the truth of their origins is promised the power to change the entire course of evolution, putting the mushroom species at the top of the evolutionary ladder. The tribe that claims this prize can reshape the world any way they see fit. The Amanitas and the Leopiota see the myth as a chance to not only defeat other nations, but also to wipe out all their enemies and put their tribes at the forefront of terrestrial evolution.
Even while the Spore War rages, a great quest among all four tribes begins: a race to uncover the truth and reshape the evolutionary course of Earth. Pax, our Bolete hero, must take on this journey himself. Wo will be the first to discover the origin of the Mushroom race? Will the war finally end?

Backbreaker, which was developed by NaturalMotion, uses the Euphoria engine (which was seen in Grand Theft Auto IV). The game's main feature is that tackles are never the same thanks to the Euporia engine, which makes every tackle unique.
The game itself includes pretty well balanced graphics, an amazing physics engine, and realistic tackles. The game does not feature Pro NFL teams, due to rights by EA Sports.
Game Modes:
Tackle Alley, a mini-game in which you have to run to the other side of the field to score a touchdown without getting tackled.  It can also be played with two players. You can break tackles, dodge, or for the fun of realistic hits, just run straight toward the defender to see how releastic the engine works.
Exhibition, just a quick game which u are able to play against a friend or alone. Custom teams are also available to be used in the exhibition games.
Leagues, it puts you in the action of playing the game, versing teams pre generated by the game. "

His captor coaxes Snake into infiltrating a top secret research facility, but is in fact a clever trap devised by the US Military and Venus, a female secret agent in charge of research and overseeing the creation of a third generation Metal Gear mechanoid system. As Snake attempts to defuse this potentially devastating project, he finds himself haunted by images from the past, and faces not only a wealth of tough adversaries, but his personal demons.While the new game retains the popular card-based combat and movement system of its predecessor, Metal Gear Ac!d 2 enjoys a far more instinctive and comprehensive control system than that of the first game. Key advances include the ability to control Snake directly within 'Move' modes, while changing commands are now displayed in real-time to facilitate more rapid actions within action situations. This combines beautifully with a wider range of actions, too, with familiar Metal Gear moves such as slinging, crawling, and fighting now all accessible - and via the touch of a button.These additions drastically broaden Metal Gear Ac!d 2's strategic possibilities and the speed at which decisions can be made. Further depth is then added with the number of cards on offer more than doubles from the original game's 200 to a massive 500. These also feature new ideas, such as 'Linkage Cards' which grant the player bonuses, while 'Trap Cards' initiate specific traps tailored to the current location when used.Also key to card use is the new ability to upgrade cards to make them more powerful, while the innovative 'Cover Fire' system adds further depth to the game. And with so many new features included, Metal Gear Ac!d 2 now includes a thorough Tutorial Mode to teach newcomers the many intricacies its stunning gameplay offers, and insights into the complex assaults the 500 cards can offer.Further additions come in the form of a new 'Arena Mode'. Akin to the 'Boss Modes' in previous Metal Gear Solid titles, this pits players against boss characters from previous games in the series, and is ideal for practicing new strategies. The popular 'Link Mode' also returns in an improved state, with players using the PSP's Ad Hoc mode to link up for one-on-one tag matches using personalised decks. "

His vision and creative mind were the driving force behind the very beginning of Hellboy so all of the same dark humour and action the comics were and still are famed for is here in abundance.  The second is that thanks to assistance from the movie director Guillermo del Toro, at the helm for the movie sequel, clips and action sequences from that film will be present here too and the characters from the movie also voice their characters in the game to add to the realism.  Science of Evil, as you would expect, is a brawling action title that really shows you the brutal strength Hellboy possesses. His powers can rip apart the scenery and levels and use them as weapons against the enemy and this is often a necessity as wave upon wave of attackers descend on Hellboy.  Source - www.Konami.com "

You decide the role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge for humanity. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.
 
A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It’s up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race.
 
Key Features:
 

Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. 
Groundbreaking Kinesthetics - Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do.
Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You’ll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success.

Virtual Texturing – Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics,. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology. "

Yo, we have a four-car pileup on the DS; can you send more racers in?        Over
Burnout's best bring their skills to your DS in the fast-paced Burnout        Legends.
Features: 
• Get the series' blistering speed and intensity on a handheld•        Includes redesigned versions of the best tracks and crash junctions in        the franchise• Four-player wireless LAN options• Loads of        modes
In many ways, this is a best of Burnout, as it compiles the best modes        of the series: crash mode, pursuit mode, road rage and time attack. In        addition to that bounty, Burnout Legends includes tracks from Burnout,        Burnout 2: Point of Impact and Burnout 3: Takedown.
Burnout Legends sports several classic gameplay contests, from Crash to        Pursuit and Eliminator. You'll get your fill of these in the World Tour,        an intercontinental racing challenge that pits you against some amazing        racers. Winning these events unlocks other stops around the world and        some of the 72 cars that will end up in your garage.
The graphics are serviceable, if not a little dark on some tracks, but        you're usually going too fast to really take the time to smell the        roses. Some of the replays of wrecks are OK, but the Impact Time slow-mo        crash sequences are a DS work in progress. When you wreck, you're able        to press R to go into Impact Time, which lets you make your wreck look        more dramatic.
You can play against a single opponent wirelessly with just one game        card, but with multiple game cards, you can race against up to four        other people.
Bottom Line
The game feels a little choppy when it comes to the wrecks, which is        usually the main draw to Burnout.

So, what's new in Twisted Metal: Small Brawl? Let's just say that the term “brat pack” has taken on a whole new meaning. This mischievous crew of half-pint terrors has seized a few remote control (RC) cars and has let them loose in the most inconvenient places.

The shooting system has been the subject of extensive retouching, now enabling players to pull off much more accurate snap shots as well as being able to exert a much larger feeling of control when going for quick half volleys or difficult full volleys.
The intelligence of players has seen a marked improvement. For example, players now make more realistic runs into space, often pointing where they would like the ball played. The physical aspect has also been beefed up, with strikers using their sheer presence to turn defenders and likewise, the defenders stepping a yard away to enable them to force players away from goal and not letting them spin into dangerous positions.
PES 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. New gameplay modes have been added and features like the much loved Master League mode also returns, together with a host of new tricks, feints and animations that can be used to bamboozle your opposition.

Two warring factions arise from the rubble: the Echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the Sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time. Units Descriptions
Echelon

Enforcers Enforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the Echelon. Determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, Enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the Chancellor. They are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

Grenades: The Enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
Riot Shield Up: The Enforcers activate their energy Riot Shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


Infiltrators The arbiters of justice, Infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the Echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. Trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the Echelon infantry, Infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. All Infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. The Infiltrator always strikes its target.

Thermal Vision: The Infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


Prowlers Prowlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. Unmatched for their versatility, Prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. Echelon Commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

Search the Skies AA Mode: The Prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



Sai

Rangers Rangers perform two functions within the Sai hierarchy. Firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting Sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, Rangers form into Militia Platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to Sai commanders. Armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, Rangers are best deployed in numbers. When the Rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. They can also fire Sai energy charges at air targets.

Sai Anti Air Rockets: The Rangers can fire Sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
Commando Rush: The Rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


Spectres The silent knives in the night, Spectres are a true nightmare for Echelon soldiers to handle. They have an exceptional ability to control Sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. Able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the Spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. The Spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. The fact that Spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

Mind Control: The powerful mind of the Spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
Cloak: The Spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. The shimmering can be detected from up close though.
Rapid Slice: The Spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


Scorpions The Sai may not be as technologically advanced as the Echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. Scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around Sai villages and to provide light strike power for when Sai forces go into combat. The Rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

Sting: A ceramic shell-filled with Brood acid charged with Sai energy. On impact it does minimal damage, but greatly reduces the armour where the shell hit.

Overdrive activation now  shows its duration under the Burst Gauge in the form of a countdown  timer which counts seconds and split-seconds
New gameplay mechanic:  Exceed Accel, a special type of Distortion Drive. Activating it allows  your character to perform a specific attack in their move-set, and once  it connects it dishes out large damage, but immediately ends Overdrive.
New gameplay mechanic:  Active Flow, which acts as the opposite of a Negative Penalty status. A  character that fights offensively goes into an Active Flow, which boosts  damage and recovery of the Burst Gauge. Active Flow also increases the  damage of Exceed Accel and for some it may add extra effects and  animations!

Mastering sudoku has never been easier, thanks to Sudoku Gridmaster.
When you fire up Sudoku Gridmaster, it doesn't take long to figure out        it's a game for all players of all skills. That's why it's part of the        Touch Generations brand of games.
Entering numbers for each puzzle is as simple as tapping a square on the        sudoku grid and then tapping a number on the 1-9 keypad on the right        side of the screen. If you'd rather write the number in, you can change        to this setting which replaces the keypad with a blank area in which you        can write your number.
To help move you on up to the more difficult puzzles, the game offers        different highlighting tools to help you work your way around the board        faster. If you tap a number in the grid twice, Sudoku Gridmaster        highlights every instance of that number in the 9x9 grid. This lets you        quickly recognize which 3x3 square still needs the number you tapped. A        number will appear 9 times in the grid. In the easier puzzles, this        feature alone will help you know out many squares quickly.
When you tap a square once, an orange highlight appears, lighting up the        3x3 square in which you're currently working and the lines that        intersect the square you tapped. This feature helps a ton when your        deductive reasoning skills are called upon in the medium and hard        puzzles. A combination of the two highlighting features can be very        helpful when you're trying to solve a real doozy.
The faster you complete a puzzle, the more stars you win. If you gain        enough stars, you can take a test to win a special award and open up        even more puzzles!

Why share when you can have it all? Greed Corp is an online multiplayer strategy game in which you battle for dominance over a world once rich in resources. In order to prevail, you must exhaust all remaining resources to build an army, and use the depleted collapsing terrain to your advantage. An extensive campaign mode and multiple unlockables prepare you to take the battle online. Players can join the fight as one of four factions: The Empire, the Cartel, the Pirates or the Freemen. Each having their own reason for engaging in the conflict, each believing they are right. While mining facilities consume and destroy the lands, the gathered resources are used to create cannons, walkers and carriers: war machines to conquer the evermore valuable lands ahead. Once, lands of milk and honey, filled with opportunity. Lands that gave birth to greed.

Developed under Codemasters’ exclusive worldwide agreement with    Formula One World Championship Limited, F1 2011 will come complete  with   all the official drivers, teams and circuits featuring in the  2011 FIA   FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™.
With a new focus on multiplayer gaming, including co-op Championships    and split-screen mode, F1 2011 will invite players to ‘Be The Driver,    Live the Life, Go Compete’ with a range of innovations, improvements   and  enhancements on and off the track. Set to be the most enthralling    season yet, the 2011 FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP features two  new   circuits in India and Germany, new drivers, rules, tyres as  Sebastian   Vettel seeks to defend his title.
Developed using Codemasters’ EGO Game Technology Platform F1 2011   will  deliver an unrivalled FORMULA ONE experience that puts players   into the  heart of the world’s most exciting sport, powered by cutting   edge  graphics, advanced physics systems and integrated network play.
• Go Compete! F1 2011 builds extensively on the multiplayer options   from  F1 2010. Split-screen racing is included for the first time in a    high-definition FORMULA ONE title. Competitive online racing is  extended   with 16 players going head-to-head in GRAND PRIX™ with up to 8  AI   drivers added to simulate the full grid of 24 drivers. An  innovative new   co-op Championship enables two players to lead their  favourite FORMULA   ONE team to Driver and Constructor glory across the  course of a  FORMULA  ONE season. These enhancements are complimented by  additional  quick fire  modes including Time Attack.
• New Circuits for 2011. Two stunning new additions to the race   calendar  extend the number of circuits to feature in F1 2011 to 19.   Players will  be able to debut ahead of the drivers on the Buddh   International  Circuit, the home of the first FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX OF   INDIA and players  will be able to test themselves on the iconic   Nürburging circuit for  the first time in High Definition, as this   legendary track returns for  the 2011 season.

Players   progress  from rookie to FIA FORMULA ONE DRIVERS’ WORLD CHAMPION in an   extensive  career mode where gamers fight to become priority driver  and  shape the  development of the car by performing well in races and   earning  performance upgrades.

• KERS, DRS and more! F1 2011 includes all the new rule changes set   to  make this year’s season the most exciting yet. F1 2011 debuts DRS   (Drag  Reduction System) � the new system which enables drivers to   adjust the  rear wing on the car to give a boost of up to 10km. KERS   also returns,  giving players an extra 80BHP for up to 6.67 seconds,   enabling drivers  to blast past rivals. Combined, these systems   encourage close  wheel-to-wheel racing with new options for both defence   and attack. This  season’s new Pirelli tyres are faithfully simulated   in the game, and if  players push their car too hard they may  experience  a range of  authentic new damage failures.
• Full Day / Night Racing. The 2011 FORMULA 1 ETHIAD AIRWAYS ABU   DHABI  GRAND PRIX comes alive with a full day/ night transition which   recreates  the special atmosphere at this unique track. Every one of the   existing  circuits from the 2010 roster has been given a complete   visual overhaul.  New atmospheric effects, including dynamic clouds,   compliment a weather  system which features an advanced rain model that   affects on-track  grip. Powered by the EGO Game Technology Platforms,  F1  2011 pushes  forward the graphical standard of what can be achieved  in a  racing game.
• The world’s greatest cars, the most exciting racing. Building on   the  heritage of producing award-winning racing games for over a decade,    Codemasters is uniquely placed to realise the spectacle and   exhilaration  of racing 200MPH+ FORMULA ONE cars for all fans.

F1  2011 will support a comprehensive   range of racing wheels for the  ultimate racing experience.
• Unprecedented authenticity. Codemasters has used its unprecedented    access to the world of FORMULA ONE to connect the development team    directly with FORMULA ONE teams and tyre manufacturers. Extensive    consultancy has taken place with a range of FORMULA ONE professionals,    including race engineers, mechanics and drivers. This has been combined    with real world data including CAD and on-board telemetry to deliver a    race experience complete with authentic handling, accurate circuits  and   precisely modelled racing cars.
• EGO powered FORMULA ONE. F1 2011 is being developed on the EGO Game    Technology platform, evolved from the award winning EGO engine.   Enabling  Codemasters development talent to share tools and technology   across  Studios and Central Technology teams, the EGO Game Technology   Platform  empowers Codemasters game designers to realise their creative   visions  across multiple platforms featuring cutting edge graphics,   powerful AI,  advanced physics systems and integrated network play.

""Akiba,"" for short.
This suburban Tokyo ward's  seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic  bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress,  with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites,  it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence  would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
Enter,  the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the  town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and  cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of  their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming  veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
AKIBA’S TRIP: Undead & Undressed tells  the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who  was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and  transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the  worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter  named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an  organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi  and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save  Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

Boasting terrific audio that really heightens the sense of fear and paranoia, Alien Resurrection is a terrifying game where you never know what will be waiting for you around the next corner.

Under Aunt Lucy's tutelage it's now up to you to help restore the zoo to its former glory by treating its ailing inhabitants, improving its Zoo Rating and attracting new exotic animals that will in turn attract the crowds!


Treat animals by playing medical mini games with your Wii Remote: remove parasites, clean and pull teeth, eliminate gall stones via laser surgery and kill microscopic viruses!

Use your Wii Remote to pat, feed or treat patients in their enclosures. Find how each animal prefers to be soothed to help keep it happy and your Zoo Rating sky high
Features 48 animals, including seven not featured in the original DS version 
2-player Cooperative Multiplayer mode allows players to treat the same animals together and interact with animals in their enclosures.
Experience a 3D zoo environment to visit or treat its exotic inhabitants
Follow up on patients by visiting enclosures to ensure animals are healing properly and quickly. The Zoo Rating is lowered while animals are recovering, so the quicker you help them recuperate by feeding or petting them, the quicker your rating will rise.
Proper care and treatment will improve the all-new Zoo Rating. A high Zoo Rating will introduce new animals and enclosures to the Zoo. Be careful, though, because poor treatment and care will decrease the Zoo Rating and animals will leave the zoo just as fast as they came.
View your Zoo Rating, Medical Ratings and Plaques earned throughout the game in the Zoo Hospital Gallery
Unlock new animals, enclosures, medical mini-games, and plaques by successfully performing procedures and raising the Zoo Rating.

Gamers live the life of Beowulf, the legendary Norse warrior with the strength of 30 men who is torn between the nobility and brutality within him. Arrogant, self-serving and lustful for gold and glory, Beowulf will journey to Denmark to destroy a bloodthirsty beast wreaking havoc on a frigid land. But evil persists, and Beowulf succumbs to its lure of even greater fame, quietly maneuvering to claim the Danish throne. As King, Beowulf must face the consequences of ambition, even as war descends on the realm. As Beowulf, players lead their men, called thanes, into battle, slay the Titans of a dying age and crush the enemies that threaten to annihilate both their kingdom and people. Only then, when Beowulf looks Destiny in the eye, will he know what kind of hero he has truly become. “Ubisoft, Paramount Pictures and Shangri-La Entertainment have been working extremely close in developing Beowulf,” said Gilles Matouba, creative director at Ubisoft. “From the very beginning, we have had an unprecedented level of access to information and assets from the movie. This access, coupled with the creative and technological abilities of our team, has allowed us to capture aspects of the film and translate them perfectly into compelling gameplay elements such as the visceral hand-to-hand combat, dynamic swordplay and amazing visuals, while giving us the creative liberty to go even further by creating exclusive content for the game that is unexplored by the film and even the classic tale.” Key features:

Delve even deeper into the adventure as gamers will play through 30 years of the Beowulf story not seen in the movie to experience more of Beowulf’s life and mold their own legacy. 
The mystical world of Beowulf comes to life in stunning fashion. Powered by the next evolution of the award-winning YETI technology used to create the critically acclaimed Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Beowulf delivers an unrivalled graphical experience. 
Army of up to 12 thanes to unlock as players increase their heroic experience (by saving thanes, killing giant monsters, etc.). 
Players use the thane army to their advantage by giving orders, assigning positions, tailoring weapons to the situation or enemy and by triggering in-game mechanisms. 
The thane army evolves with upgradeable weapons (swords, mace and spears), skills and abilities. 
Use legacy experience points to gain thanes, replace weapons and upgrade Carnal abilities. 
Carnal Power allows the use of stronger attacks and special weapons. Carnal upgrades include less daze after use and prolonged use of Carnal Fury. But if used too much, there will be grave consequences. 
Dynamic combat system including combos, parries and increasing skills as the player progresses. 
Grab ability allows Beowulf to hold on to walls or climb, as well as fight up close with visceral hand-to-hand combat against enemies and giant monsters.

Build it and ride it: Build and ride your own creations, talk and joke with all your guests, and play dozens of minigames.
Create the coaster: Create 20 death-defying WHOA Coasters, including Hotrod Stunt (a nitro boost propels a car across a broken track), Pendulizer (a giant arm grabs the car just before a gap in the track, whips it around in a full circle, then sets it down on the other side), Escape Drop (the track holds the car stationary as it lifts itself from level ground to a full 90-degree drop, then it lets go).
Oversee your park: Visit 15 themed areas, like Battleville, Winterville, Spaceville, and Aeroville, all spread throughout five new parks. Distinguish your rides even more with enhanced customization options. Attach animatronics, flowers, and flaming hoops to all of your coasters and rides.
Interact with your guests: Smarter guests, better dialogue, and more focused two-way conversation make Thrillville’s socialization aspects even more amusing than before. Also, the conversation more directly impacts the story than in the original Thrillville.
Play the games: Play 34 minigames (14 new, 20 returning from the original Thrillville but with new levels). Examples of new minigames include Robo K.O., Sparkle Quest, Bandito Chinchilla, and Tank Frenzy. All minigames feature leaderboards for Xbox LIVE®.

In TimeSplitters Future Perfect, Cortez - the hero from previous installments - returns with humanity on the brink of destruction. With the help of some familiar faces (some very familiar!) he must chase a mystery foe across different time periods to trace the origins of the TimeSplitters and save the day.  The game is set in multiple time periods, placing gamers in different areas of the world during the 1920s, 1960s, 1990s, and in the near and distant future. The re-creation of specific time periods enables players to enjoy unique gameplay elements such as weapons, gadgets, characters, and environments only found in their time periods. The ability to time travel will sometimes cause time paradoxes resulting in gamers meeting and assisting past and future versions of themselves. Players will also have the ability to correct the mistakes made in the past or team up with past and future versions of themselves in climatic battles.

It’s set in a world where pure water and green forests have flourished and which once enjoyed centuries of peace and prosperity under the careful watch of the Elder Tree. However, the evil Don Hedron has seized control of the Elder Tree and transformed the land into a gloomy world smothered by Black Water. Using the last of its remaining power, the Elder Tree created a small droplet of water, Dewy, and granted it the power of the elements with the hope that it could eradicate the Black Water and restore peace to the world. Using the Wii-Remote, players must tilt the controller to slide Dewy around the landscape and also use the remote to alter the landscape and change the weather effects. Dewy can change from his droplet of water into a block of ice or a cloud to then crash into or zap with lightning the enemies that come at him. When prompted, shaking the remote will instigate an earthquake and waving it around will create a wind storm, effects that are also vital for players to make progress.

Game Features

Are you ready to become the new champion of the world? 

 SINGLE PLAYER MODE: In addition to  the Single Stage, Single Rally and Championship, amongst the classic and  established game modes .The new WRC Rally School has been improved in  order to teach you the basics of the guide and to refine the techniques  used by champions. In WRC2 now you can additionally take on the famous  Super Special Stages, in which two cars compete at a time on  two-parallel-lanes tracks. 

 HOT SEAT: In the Hot Seat mode, up  to 4 friends can challenge each other on a Single Stage, a Single Rally  or an entire Championship, playing one after the other. Who be the local  champion 

 ONLINE: Play online with friends,  challenging them in the Single Stage, Single Rally or Championship. Your  results will affect your ranking online as you try to become the best  rally driver in the world. This year, the Super Special Stage mode will  also be available online... so you can challenge opponents in a 1on1  competition with updated online rankings, that will show the best  ""duelists"" in the world 

 PHOTO MODE: Starting also this year  players can capture the most exciting moments of  races, through the  new photo mode. Just put the game on pause, frame the car and shoot.   Then if you really want to show off apply some of the many special  visual effects. 

 REWIND EFFECT: Didn't take the  corner quite right, no problem?  With this new game feature you can  rewind time and return a few seconds before it all went wrong. The  feature also helps inexperienced drivers master new tracks 

Improvements

 CO-DRIVER: With a passion to make this the  most authentic rally experience. The team at WRC2 took direction from  professional co-drivers so the in-game notes have been improved in every  rally, increasing the levels of information and making the timing of  co-driver instructions as accurate as possible. 

 REAL SOUNDS: Bring the roar of the engines of the WRC cars into your living room!  					Thanks to the many different recording sessions performed in  the field, the in-game sounds of cars have been made even more faithful  to the real ones! 

 GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of each Special Stage  has been improved thanks to meticulous attention to detail making the  streets even more faithful to those of the World Rally Championship.  This year you will face tight hairpin turns, rough terrains, winding  curves and sudden changes to the surface conditions 

 COCKPIT VIEW: The cockpit view has been  further enhanced with the introduction of the ""look to apex."" During a  hairpin nothing can escape you. In fact, the view automatically pans  towards the path you're driving, simulating the movements of the head of  a real driver, further enhancing the feeling of realism 

 GRAPHICS AND LIGHTNING: Graphics and  environmental lighting are now showing more vivid colors, making all the  tracks more real and realistic. The environment is rich in vegetation,  which produces some wonderful effects of light and shadow. The  introduction of the ""haze"" effect also enhances the scenery. 

 REAL ENVIRONMENT: Powerful vehicles, crumbling  roads, changing conditions ... the new driving experience will allow  you to immerse yourself in the world of rally as if you were really  behind the wheel of a 300 BHP vehicle, on off-road trails, on any kind  of surface. 

 PHYSICS AND DAMAGES: In WRC 2 we have  technically improved the physics. Now the car behaves even more  realistically thanks to a new suspension management system that allows  the car to be more responsive to the undulation of the surface. 			The driving experience is much more fun, realistic and enjoyable.  And we also introduced new graphics for damage thanks to an enhanced  system that allows more realistic and detailed deformation following  collisions.
