Use the Nunchuck attachment with the Wii Remote and throw punches. You can play with up to 4 friends at a time, and 1vs1 in Boxing and Baseball.
The game is shallow, but very enjoyable. Great for playing with friends and family. Just remember to wear your wrist straps; you dont want to crack your TV. It is a very immersive sports simulator.
It is more than just a game. It is currently being used in rehabiliation facilites. Many Wii owners use Wii sports for exercise. The boxing game provides a great work out.
Get in shape with Wii Sports. Party with Wii Sports.

For the first time ever, players have the option of racing with either karts or motorbikes. Players can also hit the road as their personalized Mii(TM) caricatures in addition to the handful of classic Nintendo characters found in the game. True to the series, the game features tons of racing, plenty of power-ups and oodles of objects for players to use to slow down other drivers. And 10 battle arenas will keep players busy between trips around the circuit.
The easy-to-use Wii Wheel is also sold as a separate accessory, giving every driver in the household a chance to get behind his or her own wheel. And if veteran Mario Kart fans are afraid of getting smoked by rookie drivers using the Wii Wheel, they can rest assured that Nintendo has them covered. Mario Kart Wii supports four different control options: Wii Remote(TM) with or without the Wii Wheel, Wii Remote and Nunchuk(TM) controller combo, Classic Controller and even the Nintendo GameCube(TM) controller. So there's bound to be a configuration that fits everyone's style.
Mario Kart Wii launches with a new channel added to the Wii Menu to enhance game play: The Mario Kart Wii Channel. This new channel builds on the huge online community of Wii owners and lets players compete in tournaments, check worldwide rankings, see when their friends are playing and download ghost data.

It maintains the wide-ranging appeal that attracted millions to the original Wii Sports. Wii Sports Resort is easy to pick up and play, but comes coupled with deeper levels of play that are sure to challenge even the most experienced gamers. Wii Sports Resort whisks players away to a resort that’s full of action, while introducing an unprecedented experience in physical reality. Wii Sports Resort comes bundled with a Wii MotionPlus™ accessory to provide players the most realistic, immersive experience possible – the slightest tilt, turn and twist of the Wii Remote controller is recognized. From the moment players skydive onto Wuhu Island, they’re presented with a huge selection of fun activities that everyone can play.
FEATURES

Wuhu Island has so many things to do, there’s never a dull moment. A dozen activities await visitors: Archery, Frisbee®, Basketball, Cycling, Canoeing, Power Cruising, Table Tennis, Air Sports, Bowling, Swordplay, Golf and Wakeboarding.
The activities use the precision controls of the Wii MotionPlus accessory to help players come much closer to the physical reality of engaging in the actual sports. Every real-world action, whether it’s a perfect drive on the fairway or a slice off the course, is meant to be faithfully replicated.
Each activity has multiple fun challenges designed to keep visitors coming back for more. Basketball players might compete in a three-point shootout or jump into a three-on-three pickup game. Archery enthusiasts must aim for the bull’s-eye across ever-increasing distances and obstacles.
Different activities use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers in different ways. For example, players hold the Wii Remote like a paddle in Canoeing, while in Cycling they use both arms to “pedal” with the two controllers. The Wii MotionPlus accessory picks up every nuance of motion and translates it onto the TV screen.
Depending on the activity, players can compete solo or against other players. Some activities even let players team up to work cooperatively.

Along the way, several skilled trainers, such as Gary, and many minor trainers will challenge you to Pokémon duels.

For instance, a captured Caterpie will evolve into a Metapod, which will then turn into a Butterfree. Each transformation adds more power to the Pokémon-giving you more power to defeat and capture other Pokémon. Also keep in mind that some Pokémon are rare and won't be found in your game. Newer Pokemon from Pokémon Gold and Silver do not appear in this game, either.The Red & Blue versions of the game each carry their own variety of Pokémon to defeat, collect, and train.

Released in 1989, Tetris would soon be packaged with all Game Boys. In America, the game continued to be a pack-in for 5 years. It has, on many occasions, been considered the greatest video game ever developed due to the simplicity and elegance of its design.
The goal of the game is to arrange ""Tetrads"" (a variety of shapes made of four blocks each) as they fall, to complete rows across the bottom of the screen. When a row is filled with blocks, it will disappear, earning the player points. When the screen fills to the top, the player loses.

Pose Mii- Use the Wii remote pointer to move a Mii into falling bubbles, and use the A button to change its pose.
Shooting Range- Use the Wii remote to shoot targets on the screen.
Billiards- Use the Wii remote as a pool stick to play a game of Nine Ball.

Tanks!- Use the Nunchuck attachmen or the Wii remote D pad to move a tank on screen, while using the pointer to shoot at enemies.

• Players can show their own style by customizing their vehicles with accessories that give them a competitive advantage. For instance, giant tires help a kart drive off-road, while smaller tires work best on city courses.
• People can choose to race as one of their favorite Mushroom Kingdom characters or even as their Mii™ character.
• New courses take players on wild rides over a mountain road, on city streets and through a dusty desert. Nintendo fans will recognize new courses on Wuhu Island and in the jungles from Donkey Kong Country™ Returns.

It adds many new things to the genre including WiFi online play and 107 new pokemon, bringing the total amount of pokemon in the universe to 493 species.Gameplay.  The gameplay isn't much changed from previous pokemon games, although some minor tweaks were made to the formula.  The player is able to choose between 1 of 3 starter pokemon at the start of the game, and is able to capture any pokemon to enhance thier party that appear in the wild.  Battle takes place in a turn based fassion in either 1 on 1 or 2 on 2 matches.  Moves are selected on the touch screen or with the use of the D-Pad and buttons.  Moves are now divided into physical and special based on how they are executed, unlike previous versions of pokemon where move damage was seperated into physical and special based on type.  There are 17 different types in the game.  Each type has it's own weaknesses and strengths in relation to the others. Story.  As with most pokemon games, the story centers around the hero's progression as a Pokemon trainer.  The hero must combat the evil Team Galaxy and their nefarious plans of world domination, while collecting the 8 gym badges to challenge the Elite 4 and become a Pokemon Master.  After the Elite 4 are defeated there are new areas opened up to the player to explore, and gameplay can extend indefinitely as the gamer collects new pokemon.Design. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl is a mixture of cell shaded 3D graphics and 2D environments.  The Pokemon are all 2D sprites.  Some of the sound effects are synthesized, but most of the music is orchestral.  Composers Hitomi Sato, Go Ichinose, and Junichi Masuda wrote 149 songs for the game.  Appeal. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl offer all the appealing features of the old pokemon games (the unique ability to chose from hundreds of party members, challenging strategies, and breeding) along with the added bonus of online play.  It polished many of the old gameplay functions and added some new ones, creating a unique and engaging RPG experience.  "

Pokémon X and Pokémon Y presents a new generation of Pokémon and introduces players to an exciting new adventure in a breathtaking 3D world.
You'll be able to go on your journey as a boy or a girl, and you can  choose how your hero looks overall! Find a look that suits you, and then  set off on your travels!
Your adventure takes place in the expansive Kalos region, where  you'll explore cities, meet people, and encounter many Pokémon. Don't  miss Lumiose City, the central hub of the region, where you'll return  many times on your journey.
Look for all-new Fairy-type Pokémon, the first new Pokémon type since  Dark-type and Steel-type Pokémon were introduced almost a decade ago.  Fairy-type moves are super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon. One  such Fairy-type Pokémon to meet is Sylveon, the new evolved form of  Eevee!
All-new battle formats are fun for new players and Pokémon pros. Sky  Battles feature duels between Pokémon that can fly, and Horde encounters  are massive competitions where one of your Pokémon faces many wild  Pokémon at once! These new modes will challenge every Pokémon Trainer.
In addition to new battle types, you can also care for your Pokémon  with the Pokémon-Amie feature. Feed, pet, and play with your Pokémon to  increase your bond. The more you play with your Pokémon, the friendlier  they'll become—and perhaps perform better for you in battle.
Around the Kalos region, you'll meet a lot of people. First there's  the brilliant Professor Sycamore. He's researching Pokémon, and he's  looking to you and your friends for help. He may even challenge you to a  battle from time to time. But you're also likely to encounter members  of the mysterious organization Team Flare. What they're up to is  anyone's guess.
In Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, some Pokémon will tap  into powers long dormant. This special kind of Evolution is called Mega  Evolution. In addition to far greater strength, Mega-Evolved Pokémon may  also see their Ability change, or even their type!
There's a new method of Pokémon training: Super Training! With Super  Training, it’s not your Pokémon’s level that goes up but its base stats,  the underlying values that define your Pokémon's skills in battle.  These base stats could be increased using items and other methods in  previous Pokémon titles, but in Pokémon X and Pokémon Y, you'll be able to raise them far more easily than ever before, thanks to Super Training.
The all-new Player Search System (PSS) gives you all kinds of new  ways to interact with other players. With the PSS, you can battle and  trade with players around the world, as well as share O-Powers, special  abilities that will temporarily enhance certain gameplay aspects. And  the Holo Caster feature of the PSS lets you trade messages with faraway  Trainers and receive Pokémon X and Pokémon Y news bulletins.
The Pokémon Global Link has been completely redesigned to be easier  and more fun to use! Now, directly from the PGL homepage, see your game  progress, enter Online Competitions, and more. You can even share a  timeline of your adventures with your friends and the whole world!

Halo 3 is the third game in the Halo Trilogy and provides the thrilling conclusion to the events begun in ""Halo: Combat Evolved."" Halo 3 picks up where ""Halo 2"" left off.
Structurally, the campaign is very similar to the first two Halo games; much of the game consists of first-person shooter (FPS) “run-and-gun” action, with some lengthy segments involving vehicles thrown in for good measure. Up to four players can play through the campaign, either on the same console or on Xbox live.
In the online mode, up to 16 players can take part in contests over 11 different maps in a plethora of different battle types, which are all customisable. A new addition is the match moderation feature known as The Forge, which allows players to move objects around the different levels in real time, as well as spawn weapons and vehicles.
The game also offers players the ability to save and edit video clips from their battles. Camera perspective in this theatre mode isn’t fixed, so players can relive their online victories (and losses) from every possible angle.

Brawl has been one of the most highly anticipated games of the generation. Departing from the classic style of fighting game and featuring a whole host of characters from a slough of Nintendo games, the Smash Bros. series is most definitely a unique one.
Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the third game of the series that originally began on the Nintendo 64 with Super Smash Bros. In the Smash Bros. series, rather than whittling down a player's health meter, damage taken is measured by a growing percentage level. As the player's damage percentage increases, their character is launched further and further by enemy attacks. Additionally, instead of trying to knock out a player by eliminating their health, one tries to knock the player off the arena, much like in sumo wrestling.
In Brawl, this gameplay is that much more intense. Featuring a total of thirty-five characters (fourteen to unlock), over thirty different stages (including a host of stages from Melee, as well as custom stages!), fifty-two different battle items, and a massively detailed single-player adventure mode known as The Subspace Emissary. Tie that in with a variety of new moves, new combat features (such as the Final Smash), and massively updated graphics, and you'll find that Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a must-have!

Make no mistake -- videogames have grown up, and GTA3 demonstrates that fully. Not only is the content severely mature -- how could a game putting you in the shoes of a mob gun-for-hire who has no qualms against hit orders, car jackings, or public use of heavy artillery not earn that ""M"" rating? -- but the game itself shows incredible leaps in production values to achieve that gritty reality. Hollywood talents such as Michael Rapaport, and Michael Madson give voice to the gangland thugs and Mafioso, while the PlayStation 2 super-charges GTA3's massive scale of crowded streets crammed with cars to steal. Liberty City is wide open to those who control it, and you're the kind of guy who makes his own key. In all seriousness, this game is rated ""Mature"" for a reason -- it's not for those under 17.

It was released on November 6, 2007 in North America, on November 7, 2007 in Australia, and on November 9, 2007 in Europe.

There is also a variety of cameo-style missions where you play as various other soldiers such as an AC-130 Spectre Gunship gunner, or as one part of a two-man sniper team behind enemy lines in a flashback-style mission.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare focuses on the variation of modern warfare as an infantry soldier by allowing the player to control soldiers in a vast number of different scenarios, straying away from the constant straightforward action of previous Call of Duty titles and allowing for both heavy intensity fire fights and slower paced drama styled intensity. The series' move to modern warfare has also introduced a variety of new modern weapons and technology to be introduced to the Call of Duty franchise.

The Whole Family Stars in its Own Electronic Board Game
Most video games require players to focus their attention on a screen.        Now Nintendo brings the action into the living room with Wii Party, a        game that changes the way people interact with other players. Featuring        13 different party game modes and 70+ minigames, Wii Party can be        enjoyed by everyone in the family, regardless of age.
FEATURES:

 Some of the 13 different party game modes take the fun out of the TV          and into the living room. Players have to interact with one another in          the real world to get the results they want in the game. Some House          Party games include:
Players place four Wii Remote controllers on a table. Each one emits          a different animal noise. Players win the round by being the first to          grab the controller that is making the sound of the animal shown on          the TV. 
 Players use Wii Remote controllers to play hide and go seek. One          player asks the other players to leave the room and then hides all of          the controllers around the living room. When the other players return,          they have to find them. 
 Wii Party features Mii characters in minigames in which up to four          people can play together. Each player uses only the Wii Remote          controller. Some of the party game modes are cooperative, such as          “Balance Boat.” Others are competitive, such as “Board Game Island.” 
 In Board Game Island mode, players help their Mii characters compete          in more than 70 different minigames:
 Mii characters ride a rollercoaster while players try to shoot down          floating balloons containing gifts 
 Players use their Wii Remote controllers to help Mii characters          navigate a virtual game of tag. 

*For multiplayer modes, additional Wii Remote controllers are        required and are sold separately.

The party boards and minigames are crazier than ever in a new title that shrinks down the whole Mario crew for whimsical party play.

With 70+ minigames and five themed game boards, Mario Party DS packs all the goods for portable play. And it’s brought to life with fun surprises players can see only on Nintendo DS, such as touch control, microphone control and dual-screen challenges.
Users can play as one of eight characters: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, Wario and Waluigi. They’re all ready to foil Bowser’s latest scheme. He seeks five powerful crystals and shrinks down the crew so they can’t stop him. But each of the tiny heroes wants to be the one and only Superstar that brings down Bowser.
Mario Party DS makes the series’ multiplayer action portable at last, from playing with friends on the game boards to challenging them in favorite minigames. And now players can throw a party anywhere and play wirelessly with friends, since much of the game can be shared to other Nintendo DS systems from just one game card.

Game storyline: When Mario and his friends are shrunk down for Mario Party DS, harmless locations take on menacing proportions in five game boards, such as Wiggler’s Garden and Toadette’s Music Room.How to progress through the game: In the Mario Party series, after everyone takes a turn moving on the game board, the action shifts to a minigame. In Mario Party DS, the minigames are crazier than ever, because everyday objects are a huge threat to the minimized crew. More than 70 minigames use the Nintendo DS touch screen, the microphone and standard buttons in a surprising combination of ways. Players will fling massive hamburgers with the stylus, drag huge leaves out of the way in a forest race and literally blow down a gargantuan Whomp.

Story Mode (1 Player): In this solo mode, Mario and his friends are shrunk down by Bowser. As players make their way to Bowser’s castle, they must win first place on each game board, then beat the Boss Minigame for each board.
Party Mode (1-4 Players): Compete against human or system-controlled players on a party board in a Battle Royale, Tag Battle or Duel Battle.
Minigame Mode (1-4 Players): Enjoy six games that draw upon the pool of 70+ minigames for challenges that don’t take place on the game boards: Free Play, Step It Up, Battle Cup, Score Scuffle, Boss Bash and Rocket Rascals.
Puzzle Mode (1-2 Players): Play six puzzle-action games, which include five classics from previous Mario Party games. This mode also includes the new touch-controlled Triangle Twisters, which has two play modes. In Frenzy Mode, players clear the field by twisting triangles so they connect with those of the same color. In Focus Mode, they twist them to build complex shapes, like turtles and pinwheels.
Multiplayer (2-4 Players): Using one game card, players can wirelessly share Party Mode and Minigame Mode (2-4 players), plus Puzzle Mode (2 players) and the download-only Extras Mode with nearby friends who have a Nintendo DS. Extras Mode includes games that are designed for two-player gaming: cooperative Pen Pals and competitive Desert Duel.
Gallery Mode: Check out 150 prizes, which includes figures, music and cutscenes.

Characters: Play as eight classic characters, including Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi, Yoshi, Daisy, Peach and Toad. The tiny characters will encounter many “gigantic” friends and foes from the Mario universe, including Bowser, Toadette, Donkey Kong and Hammer Bro.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Mario Party DS brings back a play dynamic from previous games: putting traps on board spaces. Players can obtain Hexes, such as the Coin Swap Hex, then stick them on board spaces in the hope that other players stop on them. "

Whether you're shaking up cola cans or lassoing barrels, you and your friends will be drawn into the action like never before using the Wii Remote™.

Play with motion control: Players row their way through a river race, punch a statue to pieces, steer race cars, mopeds and go-karts and handle a balancing pole while walking a tightrope.
Play using the Wii Remote as a Pointer: Shoot at Boos in a haunted house, drag and drop toppings in a cake-decorating competition, select the correct answers in game show challenges.
Play using the Wii Remote's buttons: Players jump and pummel their way through a football brawl, and hop and run across a field of spinning platforms
Mario Party 8 also includes dozens of new minigames, six new party boards and many new game modes. In a series first, players can transform their characters into many forms, such as player-smashing boulders and coin-sucking vampires.
Mario Party 8 also includes ""extra-large"" minigames like Star Carnival Bowling and Table Menace. One to four players can play Mario Party 8, each with a Wii Remote.

Game storyline: In Mario Party 8, a hyperactive emcee has invited Mario, Peach and the rest of the crew to his carnival, a perfect setting for the dynamic spectacle of the Wii game play. Mario Party 8 keeps the surprises coming with minigames that draw upon the Wii Remote's motion, pointing and button control in a variety of ways. Players always know how to jump into the action by watching an animated tutorial that shows how to use the Wii Remote.How to progress through the game: Following tradition, Mario Party 8 takes the social, strategic game play of board games and adds breaks for quick, action-oriented minigames. In the main mode, players travel across six boards in search of Stars, landing on spaces that are helpful (example: giving coins) or a hindrance (example: sending Bowser in to mess with the player). Several variations for these boards tweak the main goals to enhance game play for solo sessions, two-player games and three- to four-player games.In addition, Mario Party 8 includes four more minigame-infused kinds of special games, such as Tic-Tac Drop, where players earn the right to put the next mark on the board by winning a minigame.Characters: Mario Party games are a celebration of all things Mario, so you can play as 14 classic characters, the widest selection yet for the series, including newcomers Hammer Bro and Blooper. You'll also bump into many old friends and foes that span 20+ years of Mario games.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Beyond using the Wii Remote's motion and pointer control, this eighth game in the Mario Party series goes its own way with two changes:

Players can transform their character using candy power-ups. Examples: When Peach eats Bowlo Candy, she'll turn into a Peach-faced ball and bowl over characters to get their coins. When Wario eats Vampire Candy, he'll sprout wings and fly off to suck the coins from all other players.

All gameplay uses a forced split screen view. In single player mode, the top displays the course, while the bottom screen can either display a rear-view mirror perspective, or an overhead view of the whole track, displaying where all the racers are currently. In multiplayer, the bottom screen is assigned to the second player's view. The first single player mode is Mariokart GP, in which one player races seven computer-controlled drivers or AI. Engine classes of 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc are available (150cc is available upon acquiring gold in all the cups in 100cc). Larger engines result in faster vehicles and a greater level of difficulty. There are four cups to select: the Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special Cups (100cc and 150cc only). Each cup consists of five tracks and the player must receive fourth place or better in any track to advance to the next. Places five through eight are given the ""ranked out"" title. The second mode is Time Trial, in which the player races through one track in an attempt to set a record for best lap time or course time. Three multiplayer modes are also available: The first is Mariokart GP, which plays just like the single player version, but with one less computer-controlled driver. In order to proceed to the next track only one of the drivers is required to rank in the top four. The 2nd mode is Match Race, which is a one-on-one race on any track. The last mode, Battle Mode, is the only mode in which players do not race. Two players choose from four levels specially designed for battle mode and try to pop the three balloons surrounding the other player with items such as Koopa shells or banana peels. The last player with balloons wins. In Mariokart GP and Match Race modes racers can collect coins which affect top speed and acceleration. In all modes, Lakitu rescues drivers who have driven off the track for a price of two coins. In Battle Mode and Time Trials, there are no coins and thus no charge. "

Based upon the powerful Guardian Forces from which the characters derive most of their power, the Junction System allows the player to modify character abilities, commands and even their attributes. Unlike previous games in the series, the magic in FINAL FANTASY VIII is not earned or purchased, but drawn from enemies in battle. Players can opt to cast the magic drawn from enemies right away, or store it as spells for later use. The usefulness of stored magic goes beyond merely casting it however; the Junction System lets the player attach the power of magic spells to attributes, enhancing character stats or special defenses that provide resistance to certain attacks.Guardian ForcesThe Guardian Forces that the characters must equip to use battle commands and earn special abilities, are themselves powerful attacks. Similar to the summoned monsters from previous games in the series, Guardian Forces ""guard"" characters with their own lives during the summoning process. When the summoning is complete, the powerful attack is truly a sight to behold.GAME ADVANCESAdvanced 3D GraphicsNever before has the PlayStation experienced gameplay graphics as smooth and life-like as those present in FINAL FANTASY VIII. Utilizing the artistic talent that is a Square trademark, and a brand new 3D engine, FINAL FANTASY VIII will dazzle players with fully rendered backgrounds and ultra-detailed character models which move with astounding fluidity.Seamless Movie IntegrationWith the new 3D engine capable of displaying highly detailed character models, FINAL FANTASY VIII showcases the latest advance in videogame animation, the seamless integration of Computer Graphic video with real-time gameplay scenes.

It was once among the top twenty best-selling console games of all time, selling 6.6 million units worldwide and was also voted by the readers of the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu to be the greatest video game of all-time. Set in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story centers around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging force known as ""Sin"". Final Fantasy X marks the Final Fantasy series' transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas, achieved with the PlayStation 2’s Emotion Engine processor. Though pre-rendered backgrounds are not entirely absent, their use has been restricted to less vibrant locations, such as building interiors. Final Fantasy X is also the first game in the series to feature a wide range of realistic facial expressions, as well as other technological developments in graphical effects achieved, such as variance in lighting and shadow from one section of a character's clothing to the next. Final Fantasy X is also the first in the series to feature voice-over actors, as well as the first to spawn a direct sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. Final Fantasy X introduces other significant advances in the Final Fantasy series. For instance, because of the implementation of voice-overs, scenes in the game are paced according to the time taken for dialogue to be spoken, whereas previous games in the series incorporated scrolling subtitles. Final Fantasy X features changes in world design, with a focus placed on realism. The gameplay makes a significant departure from past games as well, incorporating several new elements. "

Two years have passed since the original Splatoon™ game was released, and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job!

Showing the world what the Nintendo 64 is capable of, Goldeneye is a first person shooter that sets a benchmark for console-based shooters everywhere. Taking its cue from the Pierce Brosnan movie of the same name which features the eponymous hero James Bond of the British secret service, Goldeneye features 20 levels full of action and espionage.
Starting off with the dam that opens Goldeneye so memorably, and ending on the antenna station that houses the movie's explosive end, Goldeneye strives for realism and is a lavish recreation of the events in the film. With an amazing arsenal of weapons at your disposal, plus the customary Bond gadgets, you will never feel more like the world's most famous secret agent than you do here.
With lifelike representations of every major character from the film (from Bond to Natalya) and stunning graphics, sound and gameplay, Goldeneye would be a great game by any measure. But with arguably the best local multiplayer ever to grace a console, the experience can only get better when you bring a few friends round.
This is a game that deserves to be played again and again.

It was released in North America in October 1988, in Europe on April 28, 1989 and in Japan on July 14, 1992. It was rereleased on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on May 25, 2007. Super Mario Bros. 2 did not begin life as a Super Mario Bros. title; it is a remake of the Japanese Famicom Disk System title Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic. Nintendo's own sequel to Super Mario Bros. was released in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2 in 1986. However, because of that game's extreme difficulty and its close similarity to the original game, Nintendo decided not to release it in the United States, instead releasing Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters under the title of Super Mario Bros. 2. Japan later saw the modified release under the title of Super Mario USA. Because it was not originally a Mario title, this game differs greatly from the original Super Mario Bros. However, despite its status as the black sheep of the series, many elements from Super Mario Bros. 2 have become part of the Mario series canon and the repertoire of recurring elements. The game also sold well in its own right and was critically acclaimed at the time. "

In 2007, Super Mario Galaxy took the world of video games by storm. Now        this first true Mario sequel in years re-energizes the franchise with        new levels and new power-ups. Plus this time Mario gets to team up with        his dinosaur buddy Yoshi, who adds new possibilities to the        gravity-defying game play. It’s everything you love about the first game        and more.

 Mario collects stars as he travels from galaxy to galaxy. Every level          is new, but the game retains the charm, sense of wonder and beauty in          line with Mario’s history. Mario works his way through the various          levels, sometimes upside-down, sometimes floating from place to place. 
 On some stages, Mario can find an egg, smash it open and hop onto the          back of Yoshi. Yoshi can use his tongue to grab items and shoot them          back at enemies, or to snag attach points and swing across chasms. 
 Yoshi has an interesting diet. When he eats a Dash Pepper, he gets so          hot and frenzied he can run up steep inclines and vertical walls. When          he eats a Blimp Fruit, he inflates like a balloon and floats to new          heights. 
 New power-ups include a drill that Mario uses to tunnel through the          planet’s surface all the way to the other side of a planet. 
 Skilled players will want to collect new Comet Metals, which will          unlock harder levels with even more challenges.

It was released on November 6, 2007 in North America, on November 7, 2007 in Australia, and on November 9, 2007 in Europe. The game also became available on Steam on November 6, 2007 for pre-purchase and is available to play as of November 12, 2007.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare introduces a variety of game play styles into the single player campaign completely new to the Call of Duty series. The game moves away from the standard three country-specific campaign style, and allows the plot to play through more like a film style plot with interlaced story lines from the perspective of the player as Paul Jackson, a member of the United States Marine Corps 1st Force Recon and ""Soap"" MacTavish, a member of the British 22nd SAS Regiment. There is also a variety of cameo-style missions where you play as various other soldiers such as an AC-130 Spectre Gunship gunner, or as one part of a two-man sniper team behind enemy lines in a flashback-style mission.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare focuses on the variation of modern warfare as an infantry soldier by allowing the player to control soldiers in a vast number of different scenarios, straying away from the constant straightforward action of previous Call of Duty titles and allowing for both heavy intensity fire fights and slower paced drama styled intensity. The series' move to modern warfare has also introduced a variety of new modern weapons and technology to be introduced to the Call of Duty franchise. Such showcased weapons and attachments include M203 grenade launchers, and the AN/PEQ-2 Target Pointer for use in conjunction with night vision goggles, MP5SD submachine guns, the M4A1 Grenadier, and the FGM-148 Javelin portable anti-tank guided missile among many others.

Red Dead Redemption is a Western epic, set at the turn of the 20th century when the lawless and chaotic badlands began to give way to the expanding reach of government and the spread of the Industrial Age. A follow up to the 2004 hit Red Dead Revolver, this game tells the story of former outlaw John Marston, taking players on a great adventure across the American frontier.
Red Dead Redemption features an open-world environment for players to explore, including frontier towns, rolling prairies teaming with wildlife, and perilous mountain passes - each packed with an endless flow of varied distractions. Along the way, players will experience the heat of gunfights and battles, meet a host of unique characters, struggle against the harshness of one of the world’s last remaining wildernesses, and ultimately pick their own precarious path through an epic story about the death of the Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it.

Retro Studios brings Donkey Kong back in a new side-scrolling adventure with familiar characters and new levels that reignite the passion players had for the Super NES original.
FEATURES:

Retro Studios faithfully restores everything that made the original series great, from barrel cannons to mine carts, and then builds on those elements with stunning graphics and new layers of depth to the world and game play. The game offers the traditional side-scrolling experience everyone loved, but with levels created in fully rendered 3-D environments.
Diddy Kong joins the quest. With his trusty backpack, he can produce a jet pack or Peanut Pop Guns to give Donkey Kong more abilities.
For the first time ever, the franchise features the ability for two people to play together at the same time – one as Donkey Kong, one as Diddy Kong. Players can navigate the levels separately or as one unit. Diddy Kong can ride on Donkey Kong’s back and hop off whenever he pleases, allowing novice players to ride on Donkey Kong’s back through more challenging areas of the game.
Hidden items, puzzle pieces and other surprises are found all through the jungle. Spell out K-O-N-G by the end of each level to earn an extra bonus.
Motion controls give players a real feeling of control. Players move Donkey Kong using the Control Stick on the Nunchuk controller and can shake the Wii Remote controller to make Donkey Kong slap the ground.
Vibrant colors, beautiful graphics and fun characters draw players in. Even people who have never played a Donkey Kong game before can pick up a controller and start collecting loads of bananas.
Every level offers new fun and new challenges. Sometimes Donkey Kong is running through the jungle, sometimes his action takes place on a tropical beach and other times he must become a master of timing as he jumps chasms in a mine cart.

There’s no one way to play Minecraft. It’s an  open-ended game where players decide what they want to do by themselves!  Minecraft offers several modes, though: Creative Mode, where players  are given limitless resources to build whatever they can imagine; and  Survival Mode, where players must explore the world and mine its  resources to feed, house and defend themselves. Or you can join your  friends online and make up your own rules!

Nearly every block in the world of  Minecraft can be  broken down by mining and collected. Then those bits  can be recombined  to build new stuff!Punch a tree until you get some wood, turn the wood  into planks and then combine the planks to create a crafting table. You  can use the crafting table to make all kinds of useful tools, so long as  you find the right ingredients.
Minecraft on PS3 supports split-screen play for up to four players, and  offers a heap of extra cool stuff for you to download, like specially  crafted skin-packs, console-only competitive modes, mini games and more!  Available as a physical disc or digitally from the PlayStation store.

Boasting state of the art graphics, voice acting beyond the usual level seen in videogames and a stroyline that can easily sit alongside Hollywood action epics, the game is nothing short of revelatory.
Building on his successful series, Hideo Kojima has crafted a game that mixes 3rd person action with a new type of gameplay; stealth. Featuring brilliant artificial intelligence in its enemies, the game tasks you to break into a military base and stop a group of terrorists from firing a nuclear weapon from a launching platform known as Metal Gear Rex.
Our protaganist, codenamed Solid Snake, is a likeable hero, with a penchant for smoking ciagrettes and a talent with any type of military equipment. He needs every ounce of intelligence and strength as well, because he's going up against a team of heavily armed terrorists, not to mention their specialised fighting squad consisting of horrific creations including Psycho Mantis and Vulcan Raven.
If ever there was a game that could bridge the gulf between movies and videogames, this game has to be it. If ever a game deserved so much praise, this is it. If ever a game could show people what a games console is capable of, this is it.
And if ever there was hero we could count on, his name would be Solid Snake.

Dozens of fast-paced  stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to  defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let  players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score.
Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. After a few  rounds of Link's Crossbow Training, players will be more than ready to pick up  any of the future Wii Zapper titles, like Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad  and Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles.
Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting,  defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories  represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal  is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be  played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play  one at a time and compete for the high score.
Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes  as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the  game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center  of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without  missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.
Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look  and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off  screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These  battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to  defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.
Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using  the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever  they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his  way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.
The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a  comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls  player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the  Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires  Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new  direction (again, on stages that allow this). "

Can Link beat up Mario? Can Yoshi deck Donkey Kong? Can Kirby punch out      Pikachu? These and other age-old questions can finally be answered,      because the first-ever tournament fighter boasting an all-star cast of      Nintendo heroes (and one heroine) has hit store shelves with the impact of      a Fox McCloud roundhouse.Crossing multiple universes and alternate      dimensions, the most popular of Nintendo's characters grace this      bare-knuckle Pak. The 12 superstars are Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, Link,      Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox McCloud, Jigglypuff, Ness, Captain Falcon and      Pikachu.This awesome lineup answers long-debated questions of the      characters' comparative strengths, and the idea of a battle between Donkey      Kong and Pikachu is downright hilarious. Each character has a specific 3D      fighting arena, with power-ups and obstacles scattered throughout the      areas. Two to four players can fight simultaneously on the same screen, or      one player can battle through the tournament ladder to reach a secret boss      at the summit.The goal is to knock your opponent out of the      playing field as many times as possible within a specified time limit. If      you dominate the competition, you can kick them so hard they fly into the      sky and turn into a constellation. Link hacks away with his Master Sword,      Yoshi slurps up enemies and turns them into eggs, and Fox McCloud is      strapped with his trusty Blaster. If you get into trouble, any character      can take advantage of classic special attack items like Fire Flowers and      Bob-ombs.Super Smash Bros. is extremely easy to learn, but to      become a true master takes many hours of practice. Subtle technique can      mean the difference between victory and defeat, and each character has      unique strengths and weaknesses to learn and put to use.Super      Smash Bros. is full of surprises, like Pikachu's level where random      Pokémon are always popping up. It's strange to see two good guys like      Mario and Fox McCloud butting heads, but don't worry. When the battle is      over you'll discover that all of the characters are actually good friends. "

It was released worldwide in November 2007. On September 22, 2007, Ubisoft announced the PC version has been delayed until early 2008.The player assumes the role of Desmond Miles, a seemingly normal bartender who is also the most modern member of a long family tree of assassins. He is taken to a facility where he uses the Animus, a machine that allows him to see the memories of his ancestors during the Third Crusade, in the year 1191. Desmond assumes the role of Altaïr (الطائر, Arabic, ""The Flying One""), a member of the Hashshashin sect (the original ""assassins""), whose objective is to slay the nine historical figures who are propagating the Crusades. As the player finds and kills these targets, their conspiracy is unveiled. The player is able to travel through three cities: Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus as well as Masyaf, the assassins' stronghold.The interactive environments of the cities are populated by many people, and the way the player controls Altaïr affects how the bystanders around him react to his presence. For example, when going through a crowd, if the player lightly moves someone out of the way, it will not have a significant effect. However, if the player throws someone to the ground and hurts or kills them, the crowd may unite against him, which will also attract guards and he will then have to find a way out or hide. Similarly, if the player shoves a person aside, they may shove him back. If he climbs walls, civilians will gather around, attracting unwanted attention from guards.The producers claim the environment is historically accurate. The locations in the game are distinctive models of the cities. All of Altaïr's targets are also historic figures who died or disappeared in the year 1191, although not necessarily by assassination.

There’s no one way to play Minecraft. It’s an  open-ended game where players decide what they want to do by themselves!  Minecraft offers several modes, though: Creative Mode, where players  are given limitless resources to build whatever they can imagine; and  Survival Mode, where players must explore the world and mine its  resources to feed, house and defend themselves. Or you can join your  friends online and make up your own rules!

Nearly every block in the world of  Minecraft can be  broken down by mining and collected. Then those bits  can be recombined  to build new stuff!Punch a tree until you get some wood, turn the wood  into planks and then combine the planks to create a crafting table. You  can use the crafting table to make all kinds of useful tools, so long as  you find the right ingredients.
Minecraft on Xbox One supports split-screen play for you to build with  friends at home. You can also play cross-platform with other devices  running Minecraft on mobile, Windows 10, console, or VR if you’re an  Xbox Live Gold member. Available as a physical disc or digitally from  the Xbox Store.

The American colonies are about to revolt. You are  Connor, an assassin who has sworn to secure liberty for his people and  his nation. To do so, you will hunt your enemies across a staggeringly  large, open, and realistic world. You will unleash your lethal skills in  a violent quest that will take you from chaotic city streets to  blood-soaked battlefields in the hostile American wilderness and beyond.  You will meet legendary heroes of American history, and together you  will conspire to annihilate those who threaten Liberty itself.

Naval Warfare:
Connor  will battle his enemies not only on land, but also on the high seas  aboard his stalwart vessel, the Aquila. You'll navigate tumultuous  waters and command your own naval warship, sending enemies to their  watery graves with cannon and an array of powerful naval weaponry.

God of War® 3 finds Kratos raining carnage and destruction upon the Gods who have betrayed him and the entire Ancient Greek world. Armed with his deadly double-chained blades, Kratos will take on mythology’s darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles on his merciless quest to destroy Olympus and the mighty Zeus himself.
 
Key Features
God of War III is the epic conclusion to the Greek mythological trilogy which will complete Kratos’ story that began in the original title for the PlayStation®2.
True to the series roots, the four pillars of gameplay - brutal combat, intricate puzzles, exploration of awe-inspiring worlds, and a compelling story – all return to make God of War III the ultimate experience.
God of War III picks up exactly where the action of God of War II left off – Kratos must take his quest for vengeance to the very stronghold of the Zeus. As the Army of Olympus surges out to meet him in battle and the chaos of the Great War is reignited, Kratos must scale the summit of Mount Olympus on the back of the mighty Titan Gaia, leading his new colossal allies in an all out assault on the Olympians.
The menacing creatures of Greek mythology in God of War III are not only targets of Kratos’ brutal destruction, but can now be manipulated against their will, as he uses them to cross chasms, inflict blind rage against enemies, reveal puzzles and secrets, and as tools of complete annihilation as he makes his way on a quest fueled by hate and vengeance.
As Kratos continues on his path of revenge, he will uncover new deadly weapons like the Cestus, powerful metal gauntlets with devastating strength, and other brutal instruments of war that will allow him to learn ruthless new techniques such as grappling with enemies and launching explosive wall to ground attacks.
Built from the ground up, the brand new engine that powers God of War III was designed for one main purpose – to achieve a level of scale never thought possible. Kratos can now carve through armies of enemies while navigating on the back of a ‘living level’ – a massive, moving, breathing Titan as tall as the Empire State building.
The PS3 capabilities have allowed the developers to bring the world of God of War to life like never before. Battling in detailed and unique 3D worlds lit by hundreds of dynamic lights and featuring textures with quadruple the resolution, Kratos and his enemies now feature realistic muscle striations, detailed facial expressions, and new heightened levels of brutality and gore.

Nintendo Land is a fun and lively virtual theme park filled with attractions based on popular Nintendo game worlds.

Depending on the attraction, players can play solo, compete against other players, or even team up to play cooperatively. Up to five players can participate in dynamic multiplayer modes in select attractions.* The experiences change depending on whether players are using the GamePad, a Wii Remote controller or just watching others play on the TV screen.

Different activities take advantage of the second screen of the new Wii U GamePad controller in different ways. For example, simply slide a finger across the touch screen to seamlessly fire ninja stars in the action-based Takamaru’s Ninja Castle. In Donkey Kong’s Crash Course, tilt the GamePad left and right to safely navigate an elaborate obstacle course.

Attractions are grouped into three types: ○ Team Attractions like Metroid Blast and The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest that offer depth and challenge for 1 to 5 players. ○ Competitive Attractions like Mario Chase and Animal Crossing: Sweet Day where 2 to 5 players compete against each other. ○ Solo Attractions like Takamaru’s Ninja Castle, Donkey Kong’s Crash Course and Balloon Trip Breeze, that offer simple but fun and engaging play for one player.
Each attraction has multiple fun challenges designed to keep visitors coming back for more. Players will receive stamps upon completing special challenges.

They will see a people divided, and they will be compelled to stand up for change.
Set some years after the events of Fable 2, the character will take on the role of the child of the Hero of Bowerstone.  The game will loosely be divided into two episodes, the first being the race to capture the Crown of Albion, the second being ruling Albion.  As such, there will be much more far-reaching consequences for the game world as a result of the characters decisions than in past games.
Whilst limited information is currently available, it appears likely based off Peter Molyneux's comments and hints in Fable 2's DLC ""See The Future"" that the player will explore a region other than Albion, possibly named Aurora.  There has also been suggestion that game saves from Fable 2 could have an effect on Fable 3, meaning your old hero's life could effect their son/daughter's life.
Other announced and speculated features of Fable 3 include the advent of the beginning of an industrial age for Albion, in particular Bowerstone, possible support for Microsoft's NATAL, and the likely reappearence of Theresa (she provides the voice over for the first teaser trailer). "

First legitimate competitive 3rd person shooter of significance and possibly the greatest graphics to ever grace the screen of a television plugged into a console. The game is definitely gory and violent with lots of blood and splatter involved.
The story is centered around a group of soldiers or 'Gears' that are engaged in a series of missions fighting their way through hordes of the Locust, a race of creatures that emerge from under ground to battle the humans of the planet Sera. You take the leadership of this group of Gears as Marcus Fenix and the whole campaign is centered around squad combat and the use of cover and flanking to a significant extent.
Definitely one of the most innovative (if not most) shooters of recent years, the decision to with a 3rd person perspective and the implementation of a cover system change the mechanics of the game from your average shooter and really add a lot to the experience.
The campaign component of the game is roughly 5-8 hours long and has both single player, two player offline co-op and online 2 player co-op. Playing with someone else through the campaign makes it a much funner experience and brings the squad combat to the forefront even more than the game normally does.
The multiplayer game is 4 on 4 multiplayer with 4 modes:  Warzone (team deathmatch), Execution (team deathmatch with the ability to revive fallen comrades for a short time), Assassination (killing the other team's designated leader) and Annex (king of the hill).
Except for Annex, the multiplayer modes don't have timed respawns like other shooters do. Essentially each round is a battle of its own. This makes for a very frantic and competitive series of rounds where each player's role is maximized beacause of the small teams.
Online downloadable content has been added and more is on the way in the form of maps and new modes (Annex was added as a downloadable) so the game has continually improving online experience.
With some of the best visuals in any game ever and really interesting gameplay mechanics, good single player levels and very addictive and competitive multiplayer game, this is a must for every 360 owner who isn't turned off by the violence.

Gears of War 2 picks up six months after the events of Gears of War, and thrusts you back into a deep and harrowing story of humankind's epic battle for survival against a nightmarish force of underground creatures known as the Locust Horde.
Gears of War 2 is developed by Epic Games exclusively for Xbox 360®.

Bigger, better, and more badass gameplay: Gears of War 2 builds upon the gameplay of the first title in every way. First, the scope of the action is bigger—new characters, more weapons, nastier enemies, bigger vehicles, and grander locales offer more action, more emotion, and more thrills. Next, every major aspect of the game has been refined to create heightened, more immersive experiences. Finally, the overall tone of Gears of War 2 is more badass—replete with new weapon-specific executions, chainsaw duels, and shocking boss fights.
Jaw-dropping visuals: Gears of War 2 raises the graphics bar for next-generation games through its breathtaking visual effects, which are made possible through advances in Unreal Engine 3. New visual effects include ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, improved character lighting, the ability to render hundreds of on-screen characters simultaneously, improved water physics, additional blood and bullet decals, advanced destructible environments, new weather effects, and the introduction of fluid objects. When combined with the sweeping vistas and evocative locales in the world of Sera where the Gears of War 2 story unfolds, these additions help make this the most gorgeous game available this generation.
Gripping story: Gears of War 2 continues to push deep, immersive storytelling in video games to greater heights. Humanity's epic battle for survival is felt on both the personal and epic levels as you explore multiple story arcs that introduce new characters and flesh out the histories of familiar ones. A new in-game conversational camera system also helps bring the compelling story to life in a cinematic fashion.

Home to 10 million gamers, Xbox LIVE is a robust online entertainment network and allows you to experience Gears of War 2 either competitively or cooperatively. Enhanced competitive multiplayer gameplay over Xbox LIVE introduces new modes, weapons, and a multitude of new maps. Also new to Gears of War 2 is the ability to drop in and drop out of the co-op campaign at anytime, while allowing you to play at their own difficulty setting. Enjoying the visceral thrills of Gears of War has never been easier.

ArenaNet are updating not just the Guild Wars franchise, but the MMORPG genre as a whole with Guild Wars 2.
Everything in Guild Wars 2 has been built to let the player have fun, and everything you know from old MMOs and the old Guild Wars games as well, have been put to the test, to see if they are actually fun, and how they can be improved.  The result is an impressive game, that defies many existing conventions in the genre, all in the name of making Guild Wars 2 the best MMO in a long time. These improvements include things like:
- A dynamic world. Quests as you know them are gone, and instead there are events. Events are real time events that happen in the game, that you can join as they happen, and depending on the outcome, the world will change accordingly and a new event will be started from that.
- The personal story. Guild Wars 2 brings the storytelling of RPGs into the MMO realm, and has a story filled with choices that allow you to play through the game many times and see different storylines and twists every time.
- True cooperative play. Any person you meet in Tyria is a potential ally, as you no longer need to join a group with someone to play with them. You also recieve the same rewards in play when you play several people together as you would when you play alone, so no one can steal kills or loot from you.
- No more DPS/healer/tank setups. Guild Wars 2 has no dedicated healing profession, and every profession is built so they can provide support for their allies. Professions are extremely versatile, and this allows for a truly unique play style.

It was released worldwide in November 2007. On September 22, 2007, Ubisoft announced the PC version has been delayed until early 2008. The player assumes the role of Desmond Miles, a seemingly normal bartender who is also the most modern member of a long family tree of assassins. He is taken to a facility where he uses the Animus, a machine that allows him to see the memories of his ancestors during the Third Crusade, in the year 1191. Desmond assumes the role of Altaïr (الطائر, Arabic, ""The Flying One""), a member of the Hashshashin sect (the original ""assassins""), whose objective is to slay the nine historical figures who are propagating the Crusades. As the player finds and kills these targets, their conspiracy is unveiled. The player is able to travel through three cities: Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus as well as Masyaf, the assassins' stronghold. The interactive environments of the cities are populated by many people, and the way the player controls Altaïr affects how the bystanders around him react to his presence. For example, when going through a crowd, if the player lightly moves someone out of the way, it will not have a significant effect. However, if the player throws someone to the ground and hurts or kills them, the crowd may unite against him, which will also attract guards and he will then have to find a way out or hide. Similarly, if the player shoves a person aside, they may shove him back. If he climbs walls, civilians will gather around, attracting unwanted attention from guards. The producers claim the environment is historically accurate. The locations in the game are distinctive models of the cities. All of Altaïr's targets are also historic figures who died or disappeared in the year 1191, although not necessarily by assassination.  "

The game starts out like the opening of The Wind Waker, telling the story of what happened in the last game. It tells you how Tetra and her pirate crew picked up Link from Outset island, and how they found out that Tetra is Zelda, and defeated Ganondorf. The story that is told is left off with Link riding aboard Tetra's ship. Link, Tetra and her pirates are at sea looking for the ""Ghost Ship"" rumored to ply the waters in that area, taking sailors and residents of the nearby islands. Tetra, convinced that the Ghost Ship is simply a bunch of trouble-making pirates, is determined to teach them that pirates have rules, too. When a mysterious ship appears in the middle of a dense fog, Tetra jumps aboard to explore. As the ship pulls away and begins to vanish with her on board, Link attempts to leap over and save her only to fall into the water himself. After having a vision of Tetra being surrounded by darkness and calling for his help, Link finds himself awakened on a nearby island by a curious fairy. With the fairy’s help, he sets off in search of Tetra, and a way back to where they belong.A multiplayer battle mode is also included in Phantom Hourglass. This battle mode is a 1-on-1 multiplayer game officially dubbed ""Hide-and-Go-Seek"" by Eiji Aonuma. In an arena, one player takes on the role of Link, while the other player, on defense, controls three Phantom Guardians. Players of both sides are aided by power-up items that shortly appear on the playing field, such as the Pegasus Shoes, a Decoy, a Time Increase and a Whirlwind maker.Link’s goal is to grab a Force Gem from one of the many zones and carry it to his own base at one side of the arena. The other player, controlling the three Phantom Guardians, must try to find and catch Link before he scores any points. When Link is caught, or if the turn-time has passed, players switch sides. A game consists of three rounds, and in each round, each player takes a turn at both sides.

Unleash Your Inner Rock Legend
Guitar Hero™ III: Legends of Rock continues to build on Guitar Hero’s        successful easy to play, but difficult to master gameplay mechanic to        take the franchise to a whole new level. With master tracks from        legendary bands like Sex Pistols, Guns ‘N’ Roses, Rolling Stones,        Metallica, and Pearl Jam, along with original music composed        specifically for the game by iconic guitarists Slash and Tom Morello,        Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock sports the greatest soundtrack to ever        find its way into a videogame. Vastly improved graphics immerse gamers        into their rock arenas and heighten their visual experience while the        new wireless Gibson guitar controllers allow the players to channel        their inner guitar gods. The arcade-inspired battle mode, expanded co-op        career and boss battles add depth and extend gameplay for countless        hours of shred time.
Crank it up to 11 and get ready to rock – Featuring over        70% master recordings, spanning over 40 years of music across many rock        genres, Guitar Hero fans have the opportunity to shred to one of the        greatest compilations of music ever. Adding to the track list are some        of the most legendary European anthems with a vast array of downloadable        content post-launch. From Metallica to Muse and Rolling Stones to Rage        Against the Machine, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock offers up a truly        legendary set list.
Truly exclusive music – Multiple tracks that can only be        found in the game include guitar icons Slash and Tom Morello        contributing original guitar riffs for their boss battles. Also, the Sex        Pistols re-entered the studio for the first time in 30 years to        re-record “Anarchy in the U.K.” providing Guitar Hero III: Legends of        Rock an original recording not available anywhere else. Additionally,        Living Colour re-recorded their Grammy Award winning “Cult of        Personality” adding a solo that left legendary guitarist Vernon Reid        grunting.
An authentic look and feel – Improving the graphics from        the ground up have created a more intense visual element giving guitar        heroes the sense of performing on their own rock stage. Slash, Tom        Morello and Bret Michaels spent hours in motion capture suits so that        their movements and styles were translated perfectly to their in-game        characters. Venue light shows have been coordinated for each song along        with choreographing the animations for each band member. Ultra-detailed        textures in the fictional characters and multiple outfits give the        option of customizing the guitarist to meet everyone’s inner grunge,        punk, metal or anything in between.
Rock this way – The arcade-inspired battle mode adds a new        dimension to the Guitar Hero franchise. The idea isn’t necessarily to        hit the most notes, but rather hit the right ones and learn the nuances        of using the power-up attacks. With Guitar Battle, Star Power sequences        are replaced with Battle Power sequences. Hit every note in the Battle        Power sequence and receive a power-up that can be used to attack the        competition.
You’ve got to beat the best, to be the best – Battle mode        lends itself to the boss battles featuring Slash and Tom Morello. After        defeating a boss, unlock them as a playable character and continue to        the encore for the set list, which is a master recording of one of their        most legendary songs. After defeating Slash, the next performance is        “Welcome to the Jungle” and Slash stays on stage to play with the gamer.        Likewise for Tom Morello and the hard-hitting “Bulls on Parade.”
It takes two – Taking the co-op experience to the next level is        the new Co-op Career mode giving guitar heroes the chance to progress        through their career with a friend. Since not all songs play well for        both the lead and bass tracks, only the best songs are pulled from the        single player career mode with six co-op career exclusive encore songs.
Rockin’ around the world – Compete head-to-head in any of        the competitive game modes online to prove who the most legendary guitar        hero really is. Or, for those looking for a more friendly experience,        shred to a few tracks on the lead or the bass in co-op online.
Dude, where’s my wire? – The Wii Gibson Les Paul guitar        controller has a void in the guitar for the Wii Remote to snap into and        connects to the Wii Remote via the Nunchuk port. By using the Wii        Remote, the guitar controller utilizes the wireless technology and        accelerometer.
Axe innovation – All guitars will have detachable necks for        easier portability as well as storage. Adding a new level of        personalization to the Les Paul Guitar controllers are interchangeable        faceplates giving guitar heroes the opportunity to show their style via        their instrument.
Adapting the Wii Remote’s technology, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock        uses both the rumble feature and the speaker on the Wii Remote. The        rumble can be felt shaking the guitar when rocking out with Star Power.        The speaker comes in handy when playing multiplayer as “clinks” are        heard through the Wii Remote as opposed to being ported through the TV        speakers.

FEATURES:

Players are in control of two separate storylines. One features Bowser and his efforts to stop an arch-villain from taking over his castle. Meanwhile, inside Bowser, the microbe-sized Mario & Luigi must muscle their way through challenges and keep their nerve if they want to find a way out. They take action to control Bowser from the inside – but without his knowledge.
Players can switch between storylines at will. What happens inside Bowser affects what he’s doing on the outside. Sometimes Mario & Luigi must solve puzzles and challenges behind the scenes to help Bowser overcome various obstacles and advance the plot.
Players must make well-timed button presses to enhance their performance during battles and challenges. In some battles, Bowser grows so large that players must turn their Nintendo DS or Nintendo DSi system sideways, blow into the microphone or tap on the touch screen with the stylus to keep up with the action.
The game features the same hilarious dialogue that has been the hallmark of the Mario & Luigi series.

The intelligence of players has seen a marked improvement. For example, players now make more realistic runs into space, often pointing where they would like the ball played. The physical aspect has also been beefed up, with strikers using their sheer presence to turn defenders and likewise, the defenders stepping a yard away to enable them to force players away from goal and not letting them spin into dangerous positions.
PES 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

Go fishing, collect        shells or watch fireworks with friends? Build a snowman, exchange        presents with family or decorate your house for the holidays? Take a        trip to the city, go on a shopping spree or visit friends from all over        the globe? In Animal Crossing: City Folk, life moves at a relaxed        pace, but the world brims with endless possibilities.

There’s always something new to do. In the living, breathing world of Animal        Crossing: City Folk, days and seasons pass in real time, so there’s        always something to discover. Catch fireflies in the summer, go        trick-or-treating on Halloween or hunt for eggs on Bunny Day. If you’re        in the mood for something a little faster paced, take a bus to a new        urban city area that’s unique to Animal Crossing: City Folk.        There you can catch a show at the theater or check out the sales at        Gracie’s boutique. But if you don’t show your face back home for too        long, your neighbors will miss you.
Up to four people from your household can live and work together to        build the perfect town. Design clothes and patterns, write letters and        post messages on the bulletin board for each other, or invite up to        three friends to visit your town using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. With        the new WiiSpeak microphone, it’s like you’re all in the same room. The        microphone sits atop the sensor bar and picks up the conversation of        everyone in the room to encourage a more inclusive experience.
Get to know your neighbors. The heart of Animal Crossing:        City Folk is building relationships with the animals in your town as        well as with other players. Befriend your animal neighbors by exchanging        letters, gifts and favors. Animals can also move from town to town,        bringing their memories and stories from their old towns with them. And        since animals are notoriously loose-lipped, they spill all the juicy        details.
Express your personal style. Customize your town, your house and        yourself by collecting bugs, fish, fossils, art, furniture, clothes and        accessories. You can also go to the salon in the city to change your        hairstyle and get a Mii™ makeover. Plus, if you design clothes in the        tailor’s shop, animals will wear them and maybe even bring them to other        towns.

This beat was always the same; calm, no action and no excitement. For some reason this night feels different. Shortly before 0200 hours some form of intergalactic material is sighted through the visual particle counter. The material is too large a mass to measure. It's drifting closer. Lookout, it's a giant asteroid boulder and it's headed straight for the Cosmic Spacecraft. The only chance for survival is to dodge the boulder or destroy it. Destroying it doesn't mean just breaking it up, it means vaporizing it. Small asteroid boulders are equally as fatal as large ones.
Whew, the boulder just missed colliding with the Cosmic Spacecraft, but suddenly the Cosmic Space Patrol find themselves surrounded by thousands of the deadly asteroids. The Cosmic Space Patrol must act quickly to save their spacecraft and spare their lives. The spacecraft is equipped with photon torpedoes, hyperspace, shields, and flip control.
The Cosmic Space Patrol is highly trained to handle this situation. Could you do as good a job as the Cosmic Space Patrol? How would you protect yourself if you were caught in a deadly asteroid belt? This is your big chance to fly throughout the demensions of space and fend against asteroid boulders. The longer you survive, the more space hazards you'll encounter.
The object of the game is to destroy as many asteroid boulders as possible and keep your ship in space as long as possible. Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your ship through space and press the red controller(fire) button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. When an asteroid is hit, it may just break up into smaller boulders, or it may be completely pulverized. In some game variations you'll face additional space hazards such as satellites and UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects); both of which may be firing torpedoes at you.

Almost immediately you find yourself in human form having to battle massive amount of  soldiers, mythological creatures and monsters in order to turn back time and stop your fall from godhood.
The game is definitely the god of war experience again, with lots of action, a good solid story, great music and very high production values. The most unique aspect of the game are the very impressive boss fights. Whether it's a hero from Greek mythology you are battling or a gigantic monster or creature (lots of them), you will experience really fun encounters that mesh timing, combat and epic to perfection.
If there was one word to describe this game it would be epic. From the story to the main character Kratos (a larger than life figure), everything is like a brand new Greek myth being added to the legends of old. You constantly encounter situations and figures from Greek mythology who are made to fit the story in a very effective way usually.
The game is longer than the first at about 11-13 hours long. From the first level, the game doesn't hold back and pits you against a huge battle that will blow you away, setting the scene for the rest of the game. You will face a little puzzle solving here and there, but it is mostly combat.
One of the most interesting components of the game are the quick time events which set you up to press certain buttons and turn the joystick in certain directions to laungh Kratos into crazy moves against his foes. These are spread out among boss fights and regular enemies and spice up the action, not letting it get repetitive.
On top of all this, there is rarely a game on the PS2 that looks better than this one and there is an arena mode that you can play to push yourself and see how long you can survive against enemies. If you are an action fan this is definitely a game worth checking out. "

The game was the first first-person shooter with a story told entirely in-game in real time, without the use of cutscenes

Half-Life begins with a long expository sequence that situates the player in the game's environment prior to serious action or gameplay. The player-controlled character, Dr. Gordon Freeman, starts his day riding a tram from his dormitory, deep into the heart of the Black Mesa Facility, where most of the game is set, on his way to the Anomalous Materials Lab to begin work The tram ride gives players a perspective of the facility, setting the mood and serving as a vehicle for some comic relief moments. The ride also marks the first appearance of the G-Man, first shown as a strange man in a blue suit watching Gordon from another tram. When Gordon Freeman arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, a front desk security guard informs him that a system crash occurred shortly before he arrived, which has complicated communications between the Black Mesa scientists. The player must then acquire his Hazardous Environment suit (or H.E.V suit) before further proceeding..

After that a lot of things go wrong..a lot of things, and it's up to you to set things right, one hell of a job.

374,Star Fox 64,star-fox-64,Shooter,E,N64,Nintendo,Nintendo EAD,,9,,4,0,,,,,1997,,http://www.vgchartz.com/game/2219/star-fox-64/?region=All,1,,/games/boxart/6520536ccc.jpg,4,"It is a shame that Nintendo can't clone Miyamoto, the genius behind the Mario and Zelda games. He is easily Nintendo's greatest asset, and one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to work in the interactive medium. His latest effort, Star Fox 64, is a game designed in his tradition of greatness, and it's perhaps the best N64 game seen since Super Mario 64 - which is still considered by many as the best video game of all time.
Star Fox 64, the sequel to the Super Nintendo title Star Fox, is a shooter in the truest sense. As happens in Star Fox's predecessors, you fly along and blast away your enemies while powering up your weapons. But Star Fox 64 adds quality gameplay twists that rival the game's incredible 3D graphics. These features include multiple gameplay paths (which take you through various levels depending on how well you play, including a Tomorrow Land-like city, a meteor-filled corner of space, and a post-apocalyptic battleground), a submarine and a tank level, a four-player battle mode, and the smoothest 3D flight control yet seen on a console system. Not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. The enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, Andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out). This game is a pleasure to look at and does the Star Wars-like storyline justice with a truly cinematic quality.
At any given time you have a variety of enemies to blast, and the game alternates between on-rails levels (where you are constantly moving forward on a track with 3D movement), and slightly more open levels where you can explore a limited area. While the game may be difficult to play at first, it includes a training mode to master the somersaults, U-turns, and power-ups. Once you get the hang of it, the game becomes a fast-paced thrill ride through multiple levels of interplanetary warfare. And unlike any game before it, Star Fox 64 uses force feedback, courtesy of Nintendo's latest peripheral, the Rumble Pak. Simply, you actually feel each shot you take and obstacle you bump into.
The plot of Star Fox 64 pits Fox McCloud against the evil Andross and his crew of monkey people set to destroy the galaxy. As Fox McCloud you must lead the battle against his minions. Your wingmen Slippy (a frog), Falco (a falcon), and Peppy (a rabbit) accompany you on missions and offer advice on each level - they can also help you out in a jam, but you should expect to come to their rescue more often than not. The interaction between the four main characters makes for some of the most entertaining voice-overs yet heard in a video game and proves that the N64 doesn't need a CD drive to offer a vast array of speech. In fact, a third of the game's cartridge is used for the memorable chatter, which includes such lines as ""Let's show those monkey people who's boss,"" and ""Oh noooo!"" which is shrieked by Slippy, who's gender is, sadly, never revealed.
Star Fox 64 is the kind of game you will spend many sleepless nights with - even after you finish. The replay value will bring you back again and again. N64 owners who have been waiting to embark on their next great gaming adventure should run out immediately and buy Star Fox 64 - the graphics, sound, and gameplay all combine to create an instant N64 classic! .

Analyzing enemy attack and  defense tendencies and counteracting with precise swings of the sword  provide a satisfying experience that blends puzzle-solving with a new  and distinctly unique combat system.
Explore a massive, multilayered world that seamlessly blends  soaring exploration in a sea of clouds with intense ground-based  adventuring that blurs the line between the main world and traditional  Zelda dungeons. Link™ soars through the skies on the back of a noble  bird and dives beneath the clouds to the continent below in an epic  quest that lays the foundation for the events in the critically  acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
Prepare for intense puzzle-solving as only The Legend of Zelda games can deliver. Exploration of the forests, volcanoes and deserts  requires players to think on their feet as they solve puzzles, overcome  obstacles and escape deadly traps. Once they find their way to each  dungeon, they are confronted by even more puzzles guarded by fiendish  enemies.
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword redefines the  traditional Zelda framework and introduces an arsenal of items, upgrades  and rewards unlike any game in the franchise to date. The adventure  guides players into, out of and back to dungeons and areas they've  already completed. Along the way, Link gathers a massive inventory of  peculiar items and resources that can be used to upgrade many of his  weapons and equipment.

The game stars a bear named Banjo and a bird named Kazooie who set out on a quest to rescue Banjo's sister, Tooty, who has been kidnapped by the witch Gruntilda. Along their journey, Banjo and Kazooie receive help from Mumbo Jumbo the shaman and Bottles the mole, as well as from various other characters in smaller roles.It was originally known by the project name Dream for Super Nintendo, which starred a boy named Edison who got into trouble with a group of pirates lead by Captain Blackeye.[1] After its code was transferred to the Nintendo 64, it was shown at the 1997 E³ as Banjo-Kazooie. The game received a significant amount of hype, partly due to being marketed as the game that would be to the N64 what Donkey Kong Country was to the SNES in terms of an advancement in graphics. Originally, it was supposed to be released as Nintendo of America's big holiday game for 1997 with a Taco Bell toy promotion lined up, but Rare needed to delay it several months. Instead, Diddy Kong Racing took its place, and with Banjo as a character in that game as well, it turned B-K into an incidental spin-off of the Donkey Kong franchise. Banjo-Kazooie went on to become one of the most popular games for the console. "

Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA Soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
An advanced FIFA Soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled Manager Mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. These enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as FIFA Soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months

The latest installment in the best-selling music/rhythm video game franchise, Guitar Hero World Tour transforms music gaming by expanding Guitar Hero’s® signature guitar gameplay into a cooperative band experience that combines the most advanced wireless instruments with new revolutionary online and offline gameplay modes including online Band Career and 8-player “Battle of the Bands,” which allows two full bands to compete head-to-head online for the first time ever. The game features a slick newly redesigned guitar, an authentic electronic drum kit and a microphone, as well as an innovative Music Studio music creator that lets players compose, record, edit and share their own rock ‘n’ roll anthems.FEATURES

State of the Art Wireless Instruments – In addition to a newly redesigned, more responsive guitar controller which features a touch-sensitive slide bar on the neck, Guitar Hero World Tour will deliver the most realistic drum experience ever in a video game with an authentic drum kit. Featuring three drum pads, two raised cymbals and a bass kick pedal, the drum controller combines larger and quieter, velocity-sensitive drum heads with soft rubber construction to deliver authentic bounce back and is easy to set up, move, break down and store.
The Next Great Songwriter, is You – Guitar Hero World Tour’s innovative new Music Studio lets players express their musical creativity by giving them access to a full complement of tools to create digital music from scratch utilizing the redesigned touch-sensitive guitar controller and an authentic drum kit. Virtuosos can then play their compositions in-game and share the recordings with the entire Guitar Hero community through GHTunes™ where other gamers from around the world will be able to download and play their original tracks. Available to Xbox 360 and PlayStation3 gamers is Line 6’s guitar tone technology, enabling them to use amps, cabs and effects from the world-renown Line 6 POD®.
An Original Set List that’s Truly “Everlong” – Guitar Hero World Tour features the largest, most diverse on-disc set list to appear in a music-based video game. Comprised entirely of memorable master recordings from some of the greatest artists of all-time including Van Halen, Linkin Park, The Eagles, Sublime and many more, Guitar Hero World Tour delivers over 85 tracks for countless hours of rocking. In addition to the killer track list, the game will feature rock icons such as Hayley Williams of Paramore and Travis Barker of +44 and blink-182 and a collection of many other superstar musicians making their video game debuts on the Guitar Hero stage.
Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough – Starting with initial releases at launch, gamers will be able to expand the “Everlong” set list with frequent downloadable singles and track packs – including for the first time ever, in-game downloadable content on Wii. Making the options endless, rock stars will have a limitless supply of downloadable content through GHTunes™ creating a set list where the music never ends. In both the quickplay and career game modes, gamers can build their own playlists which allow them to select and perform up to six tracks in a single gig.
Making the Band – Guitar Hero World Tour features an all-new cooperative band experience allowing gamers to share in the most social and expressive music revolution ever. Budding rock stars can live out their rock ‘n’ roll fantasies by playing either a single instrument or any combination of instruments, in addition to the full band experience. When rocking as part of a band, up to four players can jam together in quickplay or as they progress through a career. Both band and single-player careers feature non-linear progression giving artists the option to change difficulty and instruments with a variety of different gigs available at any time.
Global Invasion – Guitar Hero World Tour introduces revolutionary new online game modes including “Battle of the Bands” which allows eight players to join online and challenge each other band-to-band to establish global supremacy. Virtual musicians in need of band mates can take their careers online forming worldwide ensembles so no rock star ever has to play a gig solo.
Fully Customizable – Featuring one of the most extensive character creators ever, Guitar Hero World Tour allows gamers to create a rock star with style as unique as their own. Absolute customization from the clothes to the facial and body structure to the tattoos and accessories, players are encouraged to unleash their inner rock legend. The Rock Star Creator doesn’t just allow players to build the ultimate rock god; the in-depth creators include the ability to customize guitars, drums and microphones. Adding yet another layer of personalization, gamers can create custom logos for their instruments, band or album covers.

Set 500 years after the original, “Fable II” will provide gamers with an epic story and innovative real-time gameplay, including a massive amount of freedom and choice to explore a vast collection of dungeons, catacombs and taverns in the world of Albion.  Features:  “Fable II” features include the following:

Choices, consequences. The innovative gameplay pioneered in the original “Fable” provided gamers with a never-before-seen level of immersion in a truly interactive world. “Fable II” expands upon the scope and depth of the Xbox classic by adding incredible new features and creating a wider, more complex kingdom of limitless choices and consequences. Players will have the option to play as a man or woman, get married, have children, and live a life of their own design — all leading to different destinies.
A land far, far away. Gamers will revisit the newly expanded world of Albion more than 500 years after the events of the original “Fable,” where they are free to explore the landscape and openly roam the countryside. For the right price, every house, hut, dungeon and castle is for sale. Players can witness how the world grows and changes in response to their decisions in incredible and unique ways as they rediscover Albion as if for the first time.
Fight with ease. “Fable II” pioneers a new combat system designed to allow players to truly master hand weapons such as swords and maces, ranged combat weapons such as crossbows and guns, and an entirely new magic system. These three disciplines, while very accessible, are also amazingly deep, and allow players to mix combat styles and become everything from master swordsman to skilled ranger to evil magic wielder, each using a different single button on the Xbox 360 controller.
A hero’s best friend. This groundbreaking addition to the game is integral to the theme of unconditional love in “Fable II.” A player’s canine companion will act as friend, compass and protector. Players must merely feed their pooch and he will love unconditionally, creating a bond that sets up emotion-filled journeys throughout this magical world.
Experience the world together. For the first time in the “Fable” series, gamers can experience the expansive and immersive world of “Fable II” with friends, either on the same couch or over Xbox LIVE together in co-operative mode. “Fable II” embodies the new Xbox Experience and will extend the Xbox LIVE service further with the introduction of orbs; orbs allow for seamless LIVE Co-op play and interaction with other “Fable II.”
Xbox LIVE® Arcade “Fable® II” Pub Games earn major gold. Lionhead Studios Ltd. is providing an unparalleled experience to gamers through Xbox LIVE Arcade. Gamers can start earning in-game currency for the “Fable II” world in August 2008, before the game’s release to retail, by downloading and playing an Xbox LIVE Arcade title, which contains three casino-style mini-games titled, “Fortune’s Tower,” “Keystone” and “Spinnerbox.” Gamers can win items such as, dog tricks, potions, and chocolates, unlock 15 pieces of concept art, and use the gold earned to purchase weapons, armor, and more in “Fable II.” This is the first-of-its-kind experience for gamers that can only be found on Xbox LIVE Arcade.

It takes both screens of the Nintendo DS to capture the spectacular        scenery of Yoshi's Island!
Return to the colorful wilds of Yoshi’s Island in a new platforming        adventure for Nintendo DS.
 
A mysterious floating island has suddenly appeared over peaceful Yoshi’s        Island. Soon after its arrival, a gaggle of kids vanishes from the        island school. Thankfully, Baby Mario, Baby Peach, Baby Donkey Kong and        Baby Wario manage to avoid being kidnapped. Now, Yoshi and the four        young superstars must set out on a wild and colorful quest to rescue the        kids and investigate the ominous island hovering overhead. Thanks to the        power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of        Yoshi's Island span two screens.
 
The Yoshis populating this wild and mysterious island take turns        transporting the babies. Each baby gives Yoshi access to unique powers        while they cling to his back: Baby Mario gives Yoshi speed; Baby DK        gives him strength and the ability to climb vines; with her umbrella,        Baby Peach gives him the ability to float high, and Baby Wario gives him        magnetism (perfect for grabbing grown-up Wario's favorite things:        coins!).
Classic enemies are back, as are many all-new ones. Yoshi's Island DS        makes great use of the double screens. Scroll up and down to see what        lives above and beneath. Hurl eggs at objects on the top screen and        tackle super-tall enemies that fill both screens.
Yoshi's Island DS sets a new standard on replayability. Hidden in every        level are flowers, stars, red coins, and character coins, so even after        you finish the game, the terrific sense of surprise continues. Enjoy the        many minigames and bonus levels, too!

You then tap the box you think has the ball. The exercise Number Tap calls on the user to match the number shown on the top screen to its counterpart in a grid of 20 numbers on the Touch Screen.  Sight Training also features eight Sports Training exercises. These activities take the principles applied in the Eye Power exercises and put them into familiar athletic scenarios. Boxing, for example, puts you in the ring with a trainer who’s holding two target mitts. You need to tap the centre of the target before the sparring partner moves it. After training for a certain amount of time, the game will automatically switch to a relaxation mode, in which a soothing voice will guide you through a set of Eye Relaxation exercises. Up to four people can save their Eye Age records on one DS Game Card. The software uses five different aspects of your vision: Hand-Eye Coordination, Peripheral Vision, Eye Movement, Momentary Vision and Dynamic Visual Acuity. Each training session lasts only 2 to 3 minutes so it is easy to make it part of your daily routine.Source - www.Nintendo.com  "

Other than the final chapter, you can arrange the heroes as you want, with the hero in front collecting the most damage. The advantage is that in the final chapter the heroes will gain enough experience so they can fend off on their own. There is an option to choose six different strategies for each character. They will then follow your strategy to the best of their abilities while you control your hero character directly. To add to the RPG-style combat, you can reserve characters in order to use a character that is more suited to the enemy or to save characters once one is gone.

It features a DS Chef, your own private cooking instructor who talks you through 245+ recipes from more than 30 countries worldwide. It's a combination of interactive cookbook and live cooking demonstration that'll have you cooking like a pro, even if you've never lifted a ladle before.
 

You and the Chef will collaborate on a wide variety of recipes, with videos of techniques, explanations of ingredients and expert advice. With its innovative interface and the interactivity that only the DS can provide, it's a perfect learning tool for the budding chef. 
As you browse recipes, just tap a box to mark ingredients you need to buy. The DS will automatically store them in your in-game shopping list. Later you can take your DS to the store and check off the ingredients as you put them in your cart. 
Search for recipes by ingredients, calorie count, cooking time, difficulty and more. 
Hands covered in batter? Keep your DS clean using voice commands to continue to the next page, repeat a step, go back and more 

.
Game Description: The first thing to do is select a recipe. With 245+ to choose from, Personal Trainer: Cooking makes it easy to find what you're looking for by helping you browse by country, ingredients, difficulty, cooking time, cooking technique or even calorie count. Once you've found something that looks tasty, take a look at the ingredients. Out of butter or need to buy some cumin? Just tap them with the stylus to automatically add the ingredients to your Shopping List. Making several dishes tonight? Just keep tapping ingredients - your Shopping List keeps it all in one place for you. Now that you've got your ingredients, it's time to start cooking. The DS Chef is there with you, talking you through every step along the way. Don't know how to fillet a trout? Watch the demonstration video when you get to that step. Didn't quite catch the last step? Just say ""Repeat,"" and the Chef will explain it again. You can pause the recipe at any time to consult the Cooking A-Z guide, and prompts will appear within recipes for specific terms you might need more information about.
Becoming a Better Cook: When you finish each recipe, you put a stamp on the in-game calendar, marking what you've made and when you made it. Later, you can search by whether or not you've made a dish before, allowing you to perfect your technique on a particular recipe, or keep expanding your culinary horizons. With an extensive in-game reference of cooking terms, pictures and demonstration videos, you can tailor your cooking experience to your level of skill, then watch that skill grow as you keep cooking.
Special Input Options: The game can be controlled entirely with the stylus, for maximum accessibility. When your hands are full, covered in cookie batter or otherwise unavailable, all of the in-recipe commands can be given by speaking to the DS microphone. The keyword search function uses handwriting recognition, so you can simply write out that you're looking for a ""sweet"" something. Finally, that same handwriting recognition is used to make notes on recipes. If you want to remember to reduce the salt, or simply that this recipe was especially tasty, the software takes the same role as the handwritten note in a cookbook.

Grab your friends and family and captain the crew to victory!
 

The party is back and bigger than ever in the Mario Party™ 9 game for Wii, featuring all-new ways to play! For the first time in the franchise, boss battles crash the party and challenge players to compete to defeat a common enemy. In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser™ and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players*, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started.

For the first time in the Mario Party franchise, each stage culminates in a Boss Battle. Collectively, players must combine their strength to defeat classic foes such as Bowser™ and King Boo while still playing competitively to boost their own individual scores.
In another first for the series, players ride across stages together in special vehicles. Players take turns as Captain of the vehicle by hitting Dice Blocks to move the party forward, hoping to land on lucky spaces. The vehicles also help to streamline game play and keep everyone involved in the action.
Unique Captain Events on each stage give players a new way to change the shape of the game.
In Mario Party 9, each themed stage has a clear destination point but with multiple paths along the way, so no two games will play the same. From Toad Road to Boo’s Horror Castle, players will encounter a wide variety of familiar Mario franchise elements in new environments that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.
Includes 80 outrageous new minigames that find players making pizzas, escaping haunted mansions, and racing snowmobiles.
No time to play through an entire stage? New minigame modes let players enjoy the action in smaller chunks of time. They can hone their skills at any minigame in Free Play mode or try the Extras mode that includes Goomba Bowling and the puzzle-based Castle Clearout.
Every time they play, players can earn Party Points that are used to unlock special items and features.

587,Wave Race 64,wave-race-64,Racing,E,N64,Nintendo,Nintendo EAD,,9.2,,2.94,0,,,,,1996,,http://www.vgchartz.com/game/2641/wave-race-64/?region=All,1,,/games/boxart/1820005ccc.jpg,2.94,"Various companies have produced Jet Ski racing games over the years, but few of those games have made as big of an impact as Nintendo's Wave Race 64. Ever since the game was originally published for the fledgling Nintendo 64 in the fall of 1996, person after person has been captivated by its blazing sense of speed, gorgeous wave modeling, and realistic ""bouncy"" physics. Now, you can download this wet wonder from the Wii's Virtual Console shop for 1,000 Wii points, which is a reasonable cost considering that time has done little to tarnish the game's beauty or fun.
Just as the title implies, you race Jet Skis on turbulent waters surrounding tropical islands.
�
The nuts and bolts of Wave Race 64 aren't much different from any other arcade-style racing game. In the championship mode, you race Jet Skis around circuits on a variety of water courses. Staying within the buoys will give you a speed boost and keep you from being disqualified, you can use jump ramps to leap over obstacles and to discover secret shortcuts, and the controls make it easy to glide through a turn or spin 180 on a dime with a simple yank on the analog stick. You can also perform a small selection of tricks, which are mainly useful for setting high scores in the stunt mode. Other play modes include the standard time-trial mode, as well as a two-player mode that splits the screen in half and lets you compete against another human opponent.
What makes the game so much fun, and the main reason why it still holds up today, is that it conveys the exhilaration of being out there on the water in a manner that's both visceral and accessible. Sharp turns and experienced CPU opponents keep you on your toes, ramps will send you flying through the air, and, because you're racing on water, you're constantly bouncing around. Waves rise and fall like they do in the real world, and that motion causes floating obstacles to shift, occasionally exposing sunken posts and shipwrecks that were safely underwater on previous laps. All the while, the controls make it easy to steer, perform sharp turns, lean forward and backward, and execute tricks, usually just by yanking or twirling the analog stick. The physics and wave modeling are very realistic, to the extent that you'll soon find yourself instinctively tilting the analog stick to land quicker and hit waves at a good angle.
A decent number of polygons went into the riders and their Jet Skis, and they react to every bounce and jolt in realistic fashion. The 3D island courses generally look nice. Some of the textures look blocky up close (mainly large rocks), but the shorelines, ramps, and course obstacles are crisp and well defined. The tropical color schemes are appropriate and appealing, as are the periodic appearances of dolphins and orcas in the water. Speaking of water, the waves in Wave Race 64 are still some of the nicest ever modeled in a video game. Thanks to the lifelike physics and splashy sound effects, you actually get a good sense of what it would be like to take a Jet Ski for a joyride around a tropical island.
The beautiful waves splash as you bounce and bob through them.
�
For the most part, the game looks just like it originally did on the Nintendo 64. However, the frame rate is steadier, and the Kawasaki advertising banners have been replaced by ads for the Nintendo 64, Wii, and DS Lite. Thankfully, the new banners aren't distracting at all. Practically speaking, the only change of negative consequence to afflict the Wii's version of the game is that you can't race against your time-trial ghosts anymore. The original game required an add-on memory pak for that feature, and the Virtual Console doesn't emulate that functionality. All things considered, being able to follow the action easier thanks to the improved frame rate more than makes up for the ability to see your ghost during time-trial runs.
Wave Race 64 is a testament to what happens when developers come up with a solid design and pour their hearts and souls into making their creation a reality. The game's brand of bouncy Jet Ski racing is just as fun today as it was a decade ago, and its gorgeous wet visuals still pack quite a punch. "

But since you are a Ranger and not a Trainer, you must release each        captured Pokémon back into the wild after they help you. Instead of a        Pokédex, each Pokémon you capture is logged in your Capture Browser, and        with more than 200 Pokémon to discover you'll have your work cut out as        you work your way up the Ranger ranks.•Play as a male or female Ranger, preserving nature and protecting        Pokémon in the Fiore region•Capture Pokémon by quickly drawing circles around them with your stylus•Use each Pokémon's special abilities to clear obstacles and to help        capture other Pokémon•Capture and interact with more than 200 of your favourite Pokémon, and        fill up your Capture Browser Source - www.Nintendo.com  "

Every 50,000 years, an ancient machine race invades the galaxy. With ruthless efficiency, the machines wipe out all advanced organic civilization. They leave behind only the scattered ruins of technology, destroying all evidence of their own existence.
Few believe this ancient legend. You, however, know it to be true. The fight to stop this extinction event has become the most important mission in the galaxy.
""You must act without remorse, without hesitation, and outside the limits of the law.""
It is your mission. As Commander Shepard of the SS Normandy, you will take your elite recon squad across a galaxy in turmoil, in a desperate race to stop the return of an enemy without mercy. To stop this enemy, you must act without remorse, without hesitation, and outside the limits of the law. Your only imperative is to preserve the safety of civilized life in the galaxy - at any cost. You must become the tip of the spear of humanity, for you alone know the full extent of what is at stake if you should fail.
Science-fiction Role-playing: Perfected
Mass Effect allows you to create your own customizable version of Commander Shepard (or jump in and use the pre-created character) and plunge yourself into the center of an epic science-fiction story. Choose your squad-mates, your weapons, skills and abilities, and customize your vehicles, armor and appearance - you are in complete control over your experience.
In the course of your mission to stop the machine invasion, you may choose to follow the path of the soldier, the tech-specialist, or the biotics-specialist…each of which brings an arsenal of unique yet equally powerful abilities to use against the enemy. Wield a multitude of weapon types with precision accuracy…utilize your technical skill to turn enemy war machines against their creators…or unleash the full power of Dark Energy against your foe with devastating effects.
As you progress throughout the game you will improve your character's skills, abilities, and equipment (including weapons, armor, biotic implants and more) to ensure that you have the means to face the growing threat before you.
The role you choose to play in Mass Effect will have tremendous consequences on the galaxy around you. You will face moral dilemmas in which the decision you ultimately make will significantly alter the fate of civilized life in the galaxy.
The Vastness of Space Beckons
Your mission will take you into the deepest reaches of known space - and beyond. Aboard your ship, the Normandy, you will choose which planets to investigate, and where to take your team. In addition to the major worlds of the main story arc, you will have the freedom to visit a wide array of uncharted planets and other locations such as asteroids and abandoned space freighters adrift in space. On many worlds, take your team planet side in the MAKO in order to explore and find alien life, ancient artifacts and ruins, rogue trader colonies and a host of other amazing discoveries.
Lose Yourself in a Living Galaxy
Mass Effect combines astonishing photo-realistic graphics with innovative new dialog systems to create a cast of living characters to interact with. Engage these characters in real-time conversations that allow you to immerse yourself in dramatically charged situations.
Characters communicate with full voice-acting and amazing animation that displays their emotions right down to subtle nuances in their facial expressions. Every wrinkled brow and slight twist of the mouth is captured to infuse every interaction with a feeling of realism.
Lead Your Squad in Intense, Real-Time Combat
The struggle to stop the return of the machines will ultimately be a violent one. You will assume responsibility for the lives of your squad as you lead them into often uncharted, hostile alien environments. Each decision you make could mean the difference between victory and disaster. Although combat will take place in real-time, you will have the ability to pause combat and issue commands to your squad which they will then execute with the precision of a highly trained elite force. Upgrading certain skills and abilities as you level up your character will also allow you to increase your ballistic skill - this can ultimately lead to easier aiming, more damaging use of weapons, and biotic effects with the power to turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Pick up the baton:Command an orchestra in the conducting        game where you’ll wave the Wii Remote controller like a conductor’s        baton to lead a Mii orchestra through orchestrated music. Make them play        quickly, slowly, strongly or gently.
Ring a bell?Play a handbells game where you’ll swing        your Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers to play your two handbells as        part of a larger ensemble. Everyone on the team has a job to do: Play        one of your notes only when the tune demands it.
An ear for music:Take a tone quiz that tests your        musical ear by giving you challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in        order from lowest to highest pitch.
Bang the drum:Play a virtual drum set in the drumming        mode, the one mode in Wii Music that also uses the Wii Balance Board        accessory (sold with Wii Fit™). You’ll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk        controllers as drumsticks, and place both feet on the Wii Balance        Board—which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal. 

Create a musical masterpiece with up to four players. Anyone can play        the huge selection of instruments in Wii Music with simple motions—like        strumming and drumming.

It’s easy to play improv jams. Musicians in your band jam by simply        playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to        their heart’s content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw        in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms        your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes—just        playing for the pure joy of playing.
Wii controls immerse you in the music. You can play most of the        60-plus instruments in Wii Music using simple motions with the Wii        Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar.        Drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. Hammer away to play        piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games, Wii Music        doesn’t make you use complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing        the instrument.
Wii Music offers virtually endless ways to make music. You choose the        song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on        classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo        classics like the Super Mario Bros.® theme into Latin-flavored numbers.        The song list is only a takeoff point—it’s how you improvise with the        songs that matters.
Send your band-jam recordings to Wii Friends who have Wii Music.        They’ll see your Mii™ band members, your players’ improv styles and your        instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over        parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you.        Improv jams can be sent back and forth over WiiConnect24 and changed        again and again.

The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute,        sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world.        Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply,        Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere.        Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object        discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly        humanlike.
As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend        them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new        Yo-kai may not be so easy, though – in many cases, you will need to        battle with them and impress them during your battle.

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind® is an epic, open-ended single-player game where you create and play any kind of character you can imagine. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions.
Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind. The end result is the most open-ended RPG possible—one with an infinite number of possible paths through the game.



""We've been working with Microsoft since we first heard about Xbox. They've done a great job on Xbox. It's the fastest system we've seen and it's easy to develop for. Morrowind is going to be something really unique, and we finally have a system that can do it justice.""
—Todd Howard, project leader for Morrowind
 
With Morrowind, the unparalleled Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an exponential increase in the world's richness of detail and level of visual splendor. Utilizing the graphic power of Xbox, Morrowind features hyper-realistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal based animation, and a dynamic weather system.

It was created by Retro Studios (a Nintendo owned second party) for the Nintendo Gamecube, and is officially classified a first person adventure, rather than a first person shooter, due to the amount of exploration in the game.  Metroid Prime was the first Metroid game released since Super Metroid, 8 years prior.  It follows Samus Aran, a female bounty hunter, through her adventures and battles with space pirates and their genetic experiments.  In the Metroid plot line, the game takes place between Metroid and Metroid II: The Return of Samus.
Throughout the game Samus recieves numerous weapons and new suits of armor, upgrading her powers and abilities.  Gameplay is similar to first person shooters, although one major difference is that there is a button to lock on to th enemies.  The game is often recognized by its epic boss fights, with often large and deadly enemies.  The game has a deep and intriguing plot, but spoilers will not be given on this summary.

The Characters

Amadeus the Wizard    Despite his ongoing research for finally learning the Fireball  spell, the Wizard's talent is for conjuring peculiar boxes, and  occasionally even planks.	He can also levitate small inanimate objects.    Amadeus is married to a lady by the name of Margaret. They have three children, all of whom know the Fireball spell.
Pontius the Knight    The Knight is an eager champion of the kingdom, the protector of the  common man with a great sense of justice. Armed with his sword, his  shield and the powerful Storm Hammer, he's a formidable fighter.    Pontius's great weakness is food. This shows around his waist.
Zoya the Thief    The Thief makes her way up to rooftops and over walls with her  trusty grappling hook. Zoya is not so concerned about family or duty,  but she is content to be a hero of the Trine, for she loves adventure.    Zoya's love for treasure, however, often leads her astray.

Features 

Innovative use of DS stylus and dual screens 
Six classic and all-new modes 
Incredible artwork inspired by Nintendo favorites like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda 
10 DS players can battle with only one Tetris DS card! 
Battle worldwide on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection 

Everyone agrees: Tetris is one of the most popular games ever. But Standard mode is only the starting point of this stunning game.
Touch Mode -- Only Possible with the DS!
At the top of a heap of Tetriminos sits a cage of balloons inspired by the NES classic Balloon Fighter. Use the stylus to touch and slide the Tetriminos to clear lines and drop that cage ever closer to earth. If you can get the cage to hit the ground, it will open and the balloons will be set free.
In early levels, players can tap blocks to rotate them just to fit into the open spaces. Touch mode gets really challenging, though on the tougher levels, where you can't rotate the Tetriminos. Think hard and carefully plan your moves. There's no time limit in this brain-bending mode.
Once you play Touch mode, you'll wonder why no one has thought up this simple yet incredibly addictive puzzler before.
Push Mode -- Tetris Tug-of-War
Push against friends locally via the DS wireless connection or all over the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.
Themed to the arcade classic Donkey Kong, players must clear lines in an attempt to push the other player to the edge of the screen. Clearing two lines at a time moves the screen down and pushes the opponent into the red zone. The frantic action leads to abrupt changes of momentum. All it takes is a few well-timed pushes to quickly end a game.
Push mode can also be played solo vs. the CPU.
Catch Mode -- Tetris in Reverse
Instead of controlling the flying Tetriminos, gamers control a flying core of blocks. Maneuvering in a classic Metroid setting (you even get to destroy Metroids), gamers twist and move that core to catch the Tetriminos.
As pieces fall, the core of blocks turns into a mass that can grow to unmanageable sizes if a player isn't careful. Falling Metroids will deplete your player's energy if they touch the mass of blocks. To keep the core of blocks under control, you'll need to form a solid square, then detonate it to refill the energy meter.
Catch mode is the ultimate Tetris game of survival.
Puzzle Mode -- Testing Your Wits
Clear all the blocks using only a few Tetriminos in this innovative mode themed around the Game Boy classic Yoshi's Cookie.
You are given lines of blocks and a predetermined set of Tetriminos. Use the stylus to choose, rotate and drop a Tetrimino. Each drop has to clear at least one line. Often, the obvious choice isn't the right one.
There's no time limit, so you have all the time in the world to ponder your next move. With 200 puzzles, gamers of all ages will be engrossed for hours.
Mission Mode -- Move Quickly!
In this Legend of Zelda-inspired mode, you are given scenarios to complete, such as clear two lines at once, or clear lines with a specific Tetrimino. Move quickly -- if you take too long, you'll be hit with junk blocks.
You can play an endless Marathon game. In Time Trial, clear 10 missions as quickly as possible in Time Trial. If your Zelda-inspired heart meter runs down, the game is over.
For frantic LAN fun, play Mission mode head-to-head against a friend.
Standard Mode -- The Classic, Updated
This is the place for classic Tetris action! Gamers can play traditional Tetris solo before a Super Mario Bros. backdrop or battle others nearby or around the world!
Up to four people can battle around the world with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and see how they stack up against others on the leaderboard on NintendoWiFi.com. Additionally, Tetris DS lets up to 10 people battle at the same time via wireless LAN. All you need is one Tetris DS Game Card and a DS for each player!
For each ten levels cleared, you'll open up a new Nintendo-inspired theme. Excitebike, Ice Climber and Duck Hunt are just a few of the retro themes you'll love!

In this case, the developer is Hudson, a company best known for the Bomberman series, while the others are HAL Systems, the creator of the Kirby line (which is handling the Mario fighting game, Smash Brothers), and Hot Shots Golf maker Camelot (which is doing Mario Golf). Each of the games' focus plays to what the developers know best, in this case, Hudson's knowledge of good multiplayer game modes gleaned from producing countless incarnations of Bomberman, the seminal party-game series. How do they do that? By setting up Mario Party as a video game take on a traditional board game. One to four players compete against each other (and computer opponents if there are fewer than four humans present) for coins, stars, and bonus points. Instead of going the route of Monopoly's little dog and top hat assortment, Mario Party offers a handful of Mario characters for use as ""game pieces"" such as Mario, Yoshi, Wario, Peach, Donkey Kong, and Luigi. Each of the title's boards is based on the series as well (Donkey Kong has a jungle stage, Yoshi an island, and so on), and each differs in prominent ways. Once the characters and board are chosen, you vie for the order you'll proceed through the game by stopping a rotating number block, which reappears at the beginning of each turn to decide how many spaces you'll move. Plain spaces provide a number of coins, while specially marked spaces will draw you into bonus minigames (explained fully later) or introduce you to friendly or unfriendly nonplayer characters such as Toad, Shy Guy, and Boo. The one you least want to bump into is of course Bowser, who will either steal coins from you outright or engage you in forced minigames where you don't gain any coins if you win, and you lose coins if you lose. The main goal is to have the largest total number of stars at the end of a game, which can be bought along the way from Toad or by paying off a Boo to steal one from one of your opponents (this costs more than twice the regular 20-coin amount but is much more fun). The minigames are the Mario Party features that most take advantage of the title not being set on a flat plate of cardboard. You enter at the end of each round or by landing on marked spaces on the board. The games come in various shapes and sizes and in configurations of every player against the others, two vs. two, or three against one. Of the 50 in all, the most noteworthy examples are probably the Bobsled Run (which is reminiscent of the snow race in Super Mario 64, but with two characters sharing a sled), Face Lift (you try to drag around a mushed face a la Super Mario 64's intro), Mario Bandstand (a distant cousin of Parappa the Rapper), Lava Boardin' (you race down a collapsing platform and jump over obstacles), and Cash Bash (one player is dressed up as Bowser, and the others hit him with hammers and steal his coins). Some are skill based, while many require button mashing or joystick twirling. The winner or winners gain coins, while the losers pay out or just leave with what they came into the game with - nothing more, nothing less.Playing with a group of friends makes this game shine. There are enough random elements at work that enable huge upsets to happen about once every other round (which continues straight up to the end when bonus stars are given out that can nudge second- or third-place players to the forefront), and going after the lead player or teaming up against the computer is superfun - especially when you're trying to garner stars for the collective total (get enough and... things happen). On the negative side, some of the minigames aren't very fun to play in the multiplayer mode because of control or perspective problems, or because they're just plain boring - but that's to be expected with the sheer number of games. Meanwhile, the games that are enjoyable to play in multiplayer are nowhere near as good in the single-player mode. Really, it's that multiplayer competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they're just simple little games. The single-player mode seems thrown in the way multiplayer modes seem thrown in most other games. Mario Party is intended to be played with a group of friends, and for those people who can really take advantage of that, this game is a must-buy. The less-social gamer might want to rent. "

She spent years fighting her destiny. With courage in her heart, she faced the false gods who ruled over people for centuries.
Her  unfaltering  determination changed the world. The gods were  vanquished,  their plans  to massacre the human race destroyed. As Cocoon  fell, a  single pillar  formed, connecting the ravaged world to the one  below..  Pulse, the  underworld. It was the beginning of a new era.
However, she was nowhere to be found. Everyone was convinced she was gone, with the exception of her sister, Serah Farron.
Three years later...
A   single meteorite falls from the sky. As spatial distortions are    created, bloodthirsty monsters appear, threatening the peaceful    existence of the townspeople.
In the   midst of this chaos, Serah is rescued by a young man by the  name of   Noel. A hunter from the future, he appears in front of her with a    message.
“Come with me across the boundaries of time,” he says. “Your sister is waiting.”
She is Lightning, protector of the Goddess who rules the realm of  death and chaos. She is Serah’s sister, her heroine, her savior.
""I need to see my sister again""
Grabbing her weapon, Serah heads out on a journey as she takes her first step into a new, unknown future.

On the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with FIFA 09, the top-selling football franchise from EA SPORTS(tm) is surpassed with FIFA 10. Responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, FIFA 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA 10 mirrors real-world football, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA 10.
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves. New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

All characters have their own sets of special abilities, making each one play completely differently from the others. New captain super-abilities and sidekick skill-shots add a new level of depth to already crazy soccer battles on the most unpredictable and hazard-filled pitches in the Mario™ universe. Each field features its own set of interactive hazards that alter game play during the course of the game.There are tons of new single-player modes, from tournaments to challenges to tutorials, but the game truly shines in multiplayer. The game features a robust multiplayer mode: Up to four players can battle locally, or they can go on Nintendo® Wi-Fi Connection (by themselves or with a friend) to compete with friends and rivals. Building on the frantic fun of Super Mario Strikers, this game gets players into action only possible on Wii. Primary game-play controls use both the Wii Remote™ and Nunchuk™ controllers. Players use the Nunchuk to control their characters and deploy items. Flick the Wii Remote to perform the defensive “Big Hit” move and flatten foes. To defend against a “Mega Strike” goal attempt, use the Wii Remote to point at the screen and manually defend against multiple balls as they rocket toward the screen.Game storyline: Characters from the Mario universe clash in a sensational battle-sport based on the original Nintendo GameCube™ title, Super Mario Strikers. In the Road to the Striker Cup mode, players take their favorite captain and compete through a set of tournaments. Players must first battle their way through the Fire Cup and the Crystal Cup, eventually reaching their goal of competing for the Striker Cup. The competition is fierce, and the difficulty grows as they battle their way through the tournament ladders on their way to the Striker Cup.How to progress through the game: There is tons of fun to be had just playing a single match in single-player or multiplayer modes, but players also can settle into tournament play in the Road to the Striker Cup. Or they can try to finish 12 of the toughest game situations in Striker Challenges. Beating either of these modes will unlock new stadiums, new captains and player cards useful for game cheats.Characters: Mario Strikers Charged welcomes eight new characters to the field of play, including four captains (Bowser and three secret captains) and four sidekicks (Dry Bones, Boo, Monty Mole and Shy Guy). Back from the first Strikers are Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario™, Donkey Kong®, Waluigi, Yoshi™, Daisy, Koopa, Toad, Birdo and the Hammer Bros.Stadiums: Mario Strikers Charged features 17 total stadiums. Nine of them are new, each with its own terrain and set of perils that affect the game play. New stadiums include the Sand Tomb, Thunder Island, the Vice, the Lava Pit, Galactic Stadium, the Wastelands, Crystal Canyon, Stormship Stadium, the Dump and Classroom. Also included are the classic stadiums updated from Super Mario Strikers.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Mario Strikers Charged is all about maximizing the abilities of the different characters, as each character has a unique set of abilities and skills, not to mention super-abilities like Donkey Kong's Thunder Wham or Bowser's Fire Storm. Charging a ball provides a more powerful shot for both the captain and sidekick characters. A fully charged captain shot will result in a devastating Mega Strike goal shot. A successful Mega Strike can split into six different balls, all of which must be blocked by the defensive players by using the Wii Remote to point at the screen. Practice passing and charging the ball to increase the chance of scoring. The player can charge the ball by completing a series of successful passes and avoiding steals, or by holding the B button to charge the ball quickly. The interactive stadiums, each with its own pitfalls, make each game an exercise in chaos.Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Play: Players climb the rankings boards as they compete on Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection specific to the region they are playing in. They earn ranking points by scoring goals, posting game wins and even just competing. Players can earn up to 20 points total: 10 points for a win, 1 point for a loss and 1 point per goal, to a maximum of 10 points. With a positive structured rankings system, players are rewarded for playing games in their entirety, creating better online experiences for all participants. The ultimate reward is watching a player's rank climb the leader board. Players are matched up with opponents of similar skill levels through a rankings-based matchmaking system. The player who has earned the most points for that day will be rewarded the title of Striker of the Day, and rankings reset to zero each week to restart the competition and see who rises to the top. To keep the ranking system honest, players earn points only when competing in ranked games, not when playing against friends.Community: Mario Strikers Charged will offer a strong sense of Wii community, as players will be able to create Mario Strikers Charged profiles using Mii™ characters for their online identity and create a Friend Roster to manage their social community. Using their Mii profiles, players can track their progress on the ranking leader board and their performance against their friends specifically. The goal is to build a community that is accessible and friendly to new players, yet also rewarding for more advanced players. "

The more advanced it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes. We’ve created a house of cards. Remove just one and everything falls apart.
Black Friday, a devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City and, one by one, basic services fail. In only days, without food or water, society collapses into chaos. The Division, an autonomous unit of tactical agents, is activated. Leading seemingly ordinary lives among us, the agents are trained to operate independently in order to save society.
When society falls, your mission begins.
Key Features

Take Back New York Welcome to a new generation experience in a persistent and dynamic environment, where exploration and player-progression are essential. Teaming up with other Division agents, your mission is to restore order, investigate the source of the virus and to Take Back New York.

Utilize your gas mask to provide protection from the virus and upgrade it to enter the most highly contaminated areas.

One such group is The Cleaners, who travel throughout the city wherever the contagion levels rise. Wearing hazmat suits and wielding flamethrowers, the Cleaners leave nothing but ash in their wake.
The Agents of the Division Trained to act independently from any chain of command, Agents are autonomous and adaptive, working alone or in small groups. They are the last line of defense, activated when all else fails to save what remains.
Gear Up As a member of The Division, harness state-of-the-art technology: both networked and prototyped. Loot fallen enemies and upgrade your gear. Customize your character and your back-pack, your lifeline in the event of a collapse, and communicate with the other agents at all times with your smart watch. Customize and level up your weapons. The choices you make will help forge a recovery or plunge the city deeper into chaos.

Seriously, if you aren't a fan of this wildly careening runabout racing game, get your head checked. Sega's arcade hit has been licensed for the PlayStation 2 by the good people over at Acclaim, and what a wild ride it is! The object of the game is simple: you're a cabby, and you want to make money. Drive around the city and take people from one place to another. Collect your fare. Oh, but just driving around...that would be just too boring. Crazy Taxi is anything but boring--these cab drivers find the freaky people in town who love driving fast and getting airborne, and the more of a thrill you give them in their ride, the more they'll tip you. Of course, they still need to get to their destination on time, so it's a mad dash about town, avoiding traffic and ignoring all the rules of the road, just to get them where they want to go before the clock runs out. Gamers ride around a fantastically realized version of a city much like San Francisco, with rolling hills to bust your taxi off its wheels and shopping districts just wide enough to shortcut a taxi through. All those dodging and diving people you almost run down on your way? They're not paying, so don't be listening to their complaining!

What really makes this game rock is the DS's touch control. Whether you're slicing veggies flying through the air or ripping the clothes off a sweltering beachgoer, the touch control makes playing Wario's blazingly fast microgames so simple, even a nintendo.com writer can figure 'em out.
Did we only say ""touch""? Sorry, we forgot mic control. Yep, a karaoke-mad robot named Mike is on hand to get this party going with special mic-controlled games. For the absolutely first time in video-game history, you can blow sweet nothings into the ear of that someone special or cool off a cup of hot java.
The Usual Gang of Wing Nuts
Touch the latest fruits from the bizarro developers of WarioWare Inc. (GBA and Nintendo GameCube). Expect to make lots of spins and whirlpools to win Dr. Crygor's Slightly Unscrewed microgames. Kickin' kindergartners Kat and Anna return with a dojo's worth of Ninja Scribble microgames. Scooter girl Mona has made a career move from the gelateria to the pizza delivery business, but she's also found time to become a pop diva and, of course, develop a whole new set of extremely cuuute microgames.
That madcap taxi-driving duo, Dribble and Spitz, and way-out alien Orbulon return in wholly unpredictable supporting roles. Old-school grade-schooler 9-Volt is joined by his big brother, 18-Volt, to make five-second gems inspired by classic Nintendo games. This time, he's even gotten inspiration from Gold Digger, one of the classier offerings (not!) from WarioWare Inc. GBA.
Disco heartthrob Jimmy T. is back, along with his mom, dad, James (""Jimmy's chick-magnet brother""), Jamie (""Jimmy's disco-fabulous sis""). Remix masters James and Jamie each spins their favorite microgames.
New software developers this time are Ashley, a goth girl whose games are a ""Total Drag,"" and Mike, the aforementioned party robot. Ashley's hilarious theme song is worth the price of admission by itself.
You can also feed a special something to Wario to create Wario-Man, who looks like one of those masked Mexican wrestlers. ""Faster than a doughnut! Stronger than cardboard!"" (we kid you not), Wario-Man's boss battle challenges you to plumb the depths of someone's nose for buried treasure.
 
Microgame Madness
Some of the many all-new microgames include:
 

Shakedown Knock the fruits from the trees. 
Pet Petter Pet a dog or cat. Awww! 
Washed Up Make like a mom and scrub a kid's dirty face. 
Quite Puzzled Slide the panels to complete the picture. 
Got the Chops Slice the veggies, chop-chop! 
Crowd Control Hey, you're a superstar with no time for groupies. Blow 'em off! 
Fresh Squeezed Milk the cow. 
Pro Bowling You get three balls to knock down the pins, which may be in strange formations. 

But there's even more bonus games! How about Orbit Ball, an insanely addictive game in which you jot down lines that morph into trampolines that a grinning ball bounces off of. Can you put Mr. Goof Ball into outer space? There's even a two-player table-tennis sim, in which one player swings a paddle by pressing the L Button and the other uses the R Button.

There's trouble afoot in the        town of Decalburg, where the devious Bowser has disrupted the beloved        Sticker Fest by causing the Sticker Comet to explode. Now Royal Stickers        and pieces of the comet have been flung far and wide, and it's up to        Mario and his ally Kersti to set things right by recovering them. This        captivating hand-held Adventure will have new and experienced fans of        the Paper Mario series captivated as they navigate colorful 3D        environments, defeat enemies, collect oodles of stickers and items and        use them in a variety of fun ways.
 
FEATURES 

 Stickers are the key to this imaginative adventure. Battles are          turn-based like in the original Paper Mario game, but instead of an          attack menu, Mario whomps on his enemies using a sticker to attack.          Stickers not only serve as Mario's attacks, but also help solve          puzzles throughout the Paper Mario universe when placed in the correct          spots. Stickers can be found and collected from all corners of the          world, and the flashier the sticker, the more powerful it is. 
 Mario can also spend coins to use the Battle Spinner, which lets him          use up to 3 stickers in one turn if the icons are lined up just right.          The Battle Spinner can turn the tide in a difficult battle, so          collecting coins through the game to use it is crucial. 
 Paper Mario: Sticker Star players get stronger by beating bosses,          finding items and completing side missions for other characters in the          game instead of accumulating experience points. 
 As players progress through the game, they'll find and use more          powerful stickers to boost Mario's attack power. Players can also find          HP-Up hearts to further boost Mario's maximum health. 
 The environments in Paper Mario: Sticker Star come to life in this          visually-stunning papercraft world on the Nintendo 3DS family of          systems. They also contain a wide range of objects such as electric          fans, scissors and radiators that can be converted into more stickers,          which can then be used to solve puzzles or win battles as Mario          maneuvers through each level.

Developed exclusively for the PlayStation 3 (PS3™) system, God of War Collection features reworked versions of both God of War and God of War II on a single Blu-ray Disc™ at full 1280 x 720 resolution.  Both critically acclaimed games, which were originally developed for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, have been remastered with anti-aliased graphics running at 60 frames per second for a smooth gameplay experience on the PS3 system.  Additionally, the Blu-ray Disc compilation will bring PlayStation Network (PSN) trophy support to the franchise for the first time (included for both games).
 
The God of War series brings epic mythological battles to life with stunning graphics and an elaborate plot that puts Kratos, the triology’s main character, at the center of carnage and destruction as he seeks revenge against the Gods who have betrayed him.  God of War III is scheduled for release exclusively on the PS3 in March 2010.
 
God of War Storyline
Set in the dark world of ancient Greek mythology, players take on the role of Kratos, a Spartan warrior. Plagued by the nightmares of his past, the ash covered warrior would do anything to be free of his debt to the Gods and the memories that haunt him. For ten years he has labored for Olympus, now on the verge of losing all hope, the Gods have given him one last task. Destroy Ares, the God of War. Armed with the deadly chained Blades of Chaos, Kratos will have to overcome armies of mythological monsters, legions of undead soldiers, and amazingly dangerous and brutal landscapes.
 
God of War II Storyline
God of War saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to dethrone a God. But his journey did not end there.  In God of War II, Kratos sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War – far more ruthless than Ares ever was.  To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no mortal, or god has ever changed… his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage for a devastating mythological war to end all wars.

Starting out as a Student Ranger, you quickly earn the        title of a full-fledged Pokémon Ranger. As you succeed in more and more        missions, you will aspire to become the highest Ranger rank: Top Ranger.        Along the way you meet and capture all kinds of different Pokémon.
 
How to progress through the game: Capture wild Pokémon and create        a team to clear obstacles and puzzles encountered along the way. After        using a Pokémon’s ability, it will leave your team; however, you will        have a Partner Pokémon that will always stay by your side. As you        progress through Missions and Quests, your Capture Styler becomes more        powerful, giving your Styler more Energy and eventually advancing you to        the level of Top Ranger.
 
Characters: Hundreds of Pokémon. Players can choose to be a boy        or girl Pokémon Ranger.
 
Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Use the Capture Styler to        capture wild Pokémon. Once they are captured, wild Pokémon will follow        the player around until their powers are used (either in a Poké Assist        or a Field Move).
• A Poké Assist is when the player uses an already captured Pokémon to        help capture another wild Pokémon.
• A Field Move is when the player uses a captured Pokémon’s power to        clear an obstacle in the way or perform another helpful function.
 
 
• Pokémon Ranger is a unique action-adventure series that features a        fun, different way to capture Pokémon with the Nintendo DS stylus, which        controls an item called the Capture Styler in the game. Players circle        the Pokémon they want to catch by drawing circles around them on the        touch screen. When you complete certain Quests, the Ranger Union awards        you with power-ups, which add new upgrades and functions to your Capture        Styler, allowing you to advance as you work to eventually become a Top        Ranger (the most revered Ranger of all).
• Now you can partner with a variety of different Pokémon of each type        to complete Missions—giving you many options on how to approach        different challenges. Every Pokémon is different, and capturing a        Pokémon allows you to use its abilities to overcome various obstacles        and challenges you will face along the way. The job of a Pokémon Ranger        is never done: your duties will include fighting wildfires, rescuing        people or even delivering an important package.
• Your journey to become a Top Ranger takes you to the new region of        Almia. This game has a larger world, more Missions, more adventure and        more to do than the previous Pokémon Ranger game. It has a storyline        full of adventure and the ability to travel to and explore many exciting        new areas in Almia, including oceans, forests, deserts and more with the        help of your Partner Pokémon.
• This is the first game in the Pokémon Ranger series to feature Pokémon        from Pokémon® Diamond and Pokémon® Pearl.

When Wario™ stumbles upon a strange device called a Form Baton, he and his friends use it to learn new moves that are as fun as they are wacky. With hundreds of microgames, this game is just as wild as you'd expect from the name WarioWare, but the game play has been revolutionized. Under Wario's tutelage, and with the help of the Wii Remote, players swing, spin and squat their way to victory.

With more than 200 lightning-quick microgames and controls that range from scribbling to flailing, WarioWare: Smooth Moves takes interactive gaming to a whole new level. Players steer cars, twirl pizzas, saw logs and dance their way to victory. All they need to be the champ is confidence, a Wii Remote and their best moves.
With games that are as much fun to play as they are to WATCH people play, WarioWare: Smooth Moves brings the party to its feet. It's hilarious for players and audiences alike.

Game storyline: While pursuing a strange creature that stole his snack, Wario accidentally stumbles into an old building called the Temple of Form. Inside, he finds a mystical treasure called the Form Baton, which looks suspiciously like a Wii Remote. He discovers that the Form Baton gives him special powers depending on his ""form"" - the way he holds and moves the baton.

This year, THQ's Smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and the Playstation 3! In addition, PS2 and Xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. With many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ECW arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
Gameplay:SvR08 enables you take control of your favourite WWE superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. Thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. Submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  AI will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  In order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. What direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
Features:

Superstar Fighting Styles: With eight Superstar Fighting Styles to choose from, playing WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 will never be the same. Each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. Take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the Superstars.
Struggle Submission System: The new Struggle Submission System gives players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars using the analog sticks. Realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ECW Presence: The life of a WWE Superstar isn't always pretty. ECW invades WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 with a variety of Superstars, arenas and weapons.
WWE 24/7 Mode: Combining the popular Season and General Manager Modes from previous Smackdown vs. Raw games, WWE 24/7 Mode embraces the intensity of the Superstar lifestyle. Multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a Legend.
Giving Fans What They Want: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

It has some sort of cult like fans to back up these claims. The game came out in 1995 when everyone assumed that Super nes showed all of it`s potential.It was developed by ""The Dream Team"" consisting of Hironobu Sakaguchi, Kazuhiko Aoki, Nobuo Uematsu (from Final Fantasy series) and  Yuuji Hoji and Akira Toiyama (from Dragon Quest series). Chrno Trigger had all the aspects for being one of the  best games ever: diverse, imersive and well composed music, interesting plot, awesome character development, astounishing graphics, simple yet addicting gameplay and features never seen before on a RPG. For example, after finishing the game you could start a new one (new game+) with all your money, items and  levels. There was a good reason for this, the game had more than 15 different endings and a lot of extra optional content.The graphics were amazing. The only games that could compete with CT would be Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean. There lots of special effects, complex animations for the characters and jaw droping backgrounds. Music was one of the aspects that made CT epic. With enough tracks to make a music only release, CT had a triple cd pack released in Japan. The music would always match the game atmosphere and the players feeling The story had time travelling as the main theme. It would end up with the usual ""save the world"" theme but the way it was told made it interesting enough to avoid major rpg cliches. The characters were really inspiring and diverse. There was a favorite character for almost any kind of personality. Chrono the silent kind hearted hero, Marle the tomboyish princess, Lucca the young genius and Chrono`s best friend, Frog the noble knight with sense of duty, Robo the lonely and friendly robot from a post apocalipt  world, Ayla the lively and strong cavewoman. The battles were one of the aspects that made CT so good. It was so simple that anyone could enjoy it. There were 3 commands: attack, tech and item. Attack and item are self explanatory, tech used lots of exclusive character moves and could combine two or three characters to unleash new or improved attacks and magics. All the characters had some kind of exclusive elemental spells (two of them shared elementals but had different moves) making them nore unique and useful for certain situations. A lot of years before Final Fantasy XI, CT avoided the shift from world view and battle view. The enemies could be seen on the map and the battles would happen when you got close.

The game takes on a much more action/shooter aspect as it leaves behind most of the jump from your seat moments for fast paced, adrenaline rush and challenging set combat situations.
Although different from the previous games in the series, this doesn't mean it is non sensically different as the story, feel and characters of the game are definitely in line with previous REs.
It's a 3rd person shooter with some timed events and melee combat added to it. The game really shows off on the graphical side. Definitely a challenging game that rewards precision and experience. Some of the best boss fights in any action game are to be encountered with everything from quick time events to trying to survive against capable and impressive bosses.
The story revolves around Leon Kennedy from RE 2 investigating the disappearence of the daughter of the president of the United States in rural Spain. Eventually, you discover that there are very bad things going on in the town and around it as you encounter both paranormal and downright weird enemies trying to end your game.
Definitely one of the most fun and best games of the last generation. It runs for about 12-16 hours in the main story.
In addition to everything in the original Gamecube version, the PS2 version includes additional modes of play such as playing as Ada Wong in Separate Ways which is her perspective of the events in the game only in summarized form compared to the main story (shorter game, about 5 hours). There is also the assignment Ada mission to play around with. So it's definitely worth picking this version up if you haven't played the original (or even if you have really). "

“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""

The two biggest names in gaming meet on the world’s grandest stage in the ultimate test of skill, endurance and sportsmanship.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games brings members of the Mushroom Kingdom and Sonic Universe together to go head-to-head in 20 Olympic events, from track and field to aquatics to shooting sports. The 16 characters are split into four groups and are categorised based on their prowess. Sonic and Yoshi belong to the Speed group, Mario and Amy Rose are All-Around competitors, Peach and Tails lean on the Technical side and Bowser and Knuckles are all about Power. There have been Olympic-style games in the past, but none could offer the fun, interactive experience the Wii Remote provides.

Players can also discover secret boosts to help them get that winning edge.
Wii athletes will go for the gold medal in three game modes: Single Match, Circuit and Mission. In Mission mode, the game challenges you to complete a task by using a specific character during an event. In Single Match and Circuit modes, players can select whichever character they want and try to achieve a world record.
And it really can be a world record. Thanks to the WiiConnect24 functionality, those with Internet access can see how their high scores and best times rate against others around the world. Who will break the most records, Mario or Sonic? We finally get a chance to find out!

Unlike the traditional side-scrolling Mario games that were becoming common at the time Square Co. helped bring role playing elements and a seemingly 3-D enviroment to the Mario series.The major changes to the series come in a few different forms. First of all the game is no longer as shallow as ""save the princess"". It is intensely story driven. This allows for much more depth added to well known characters such as Mario, Bowser, Peach, and the mushroom people. The story is quite lengthy and has a few important plot twist and developments. This game also introduces a large variety of new characters into the Mario universe, two of them being playable.  The second key change is the battling system. The fighting is all turn based like a traditional RPG. All characters besides having basic attacks also have access to ""spell-like"" attacks. This can range from simple jumping or fireball attacks common to Mario or such things as lazer guns and elemental spells. A nice addition to the battle system is also the ability to time regular attacks to preform additional hits. This helps break the monotony of turn based battles. All in all this is a fabulous title with an enthrolling and often humorous story to play through with quite a few side quests to keep you busy for many many hours learning all you can about this new villan and his presence in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Eschewing genre conventions of broadly accessible player classes, Killzone Shadow Fall Intercept — maintaining the hardcore essence of the main game it’s built upon — embraces cooperative gameplay in the truest sense of the word. Combat Roles are highly specialized and highly interdependent; those who fail to collaborate will find the greatest level of difficulty.

Four Combat Roles With Extremely Varied Abilities
Killzone Shadow Fall Intercept’s cooperative philosophy is grounded in four different “Combat Roles.” The Marksman is the master of medium-to-long distance warfare. The Assault role is a close-combat terror. The Medic and Tactician fare worse in constant battle; rather, the former excels in reviving and resupplying comrades, while the latter is a master of boosting team defenses via turrets and Nano Shields.

Stories tell of a legendary solider who once waged war against the world. His name was Naked Snake, a.k.a. Big Boss, and the truth behind this legend will finally be told. The era is the 1970s . Big Boss had stationed his soldiers without borders in Colombia, South America, where he was approached by visitors from Costa Rica, a nation without a military. In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as Latin America became a key to maintaining the power balance between East and West, Costa Rica had miraculously managed to maintain its peace and neutrality. However, in various regions of the country, a mysterious armed force seemed to be engaging in suspicious activities. Now, to preserve peace in this nation without a military, the soldiers without borders move into action. In time, they would be known as the founders of Outer Heaven. Forge a new path and live the legend with METAL GEAR SOLID PEACE WALKER, the first official Hideo Kojima game on the PSP system.
 

The Latest Title in the METAL GEAR SOLID Series!: A true continuation of the ever-evolving franchise that stood the test of time and started the stealth action genre, PEACE WALKER is the first title on the PSP system in which mastermind Hideo Kojima has fully taken up the reigns to direct, write, and design the game himself.
Extensive Content for Massive Replay Value!: Arguably one of the deepest PSP games to be released as Kojima Productions pushes the boundaries of the platform to new levels while blending various game styles together in ways that will captivate and engross both veterans and newcomers to METAL GEAR.
Proven Gameplay, Story, and More: Fans of the series will enjoy the exhilaration of familiar stealth elements of previous MGS titles and will also be enticed by the new gameplay features making their debut in PEACE WALKER. Those expecting a typical stealth game will be blown away by the PEACE WALKER experience. This game is a blend of action RPG elements, RTS elements for a PSP experience like none other. Staying true to METAL GEAR form, the entire game experience is woven together by a gripping story which unfolds through the artwork of Yoji Shinkawa and acclaimed comic book artist, Ashley Wood.
Online Multiplayer Supported: PEACE WALKER provides up to 4-player CO-OPS (COperative-OPerationS) gameplay, which is a revolutionary first for the series that introduces the all-new CO-OP Ring and ""Snake Formation."" The CO-OP Ring allows gamers to interact and build their camaraderie through the sharing of items, equipment, and LIFE gauges during the heat of battle, while the ""Snake Formation"" lets one player take the lead so the others can focus on defense.

It’s a whole new ball game as Mario rocks the rim on the Nintendo DS.It's        time to throw down on the court. Take on the superstars from the        Mushroom Kingdom (and some special guests) with the super hands-on        control of Mario Hoops 3-on-3.               Control the action with the stylus                Special jams and super shots blow away your opponent                Tons of unique courts and special basketballs                Play wirelessly against a friend         Stylus pointsUse the touch screen to get you game on as you        execute tricky dribbles, special passes and sweet shots – all with        strokes and taps of the stylus. To score big, you'll need to dribble        around the court and collect as many coins as possible. When you make a        shot, you get a set number of points (20 for a traditional shot) in        addition to points for all the coins you've collected. The team with the        most points when the buzzer sounds wins the game.             You'll use the Control Pad to move your ballers around the court,        automatically dribbling the ball. However, the default dribble allows        slow movement. To get your players really moving, you'll need to tap on        the screen to accelerate their dribbling and movement. If you tap left,        the baller will dribble with his left hand; if you then tap right, the        baller will perform a crossover dribble and switch hands flawlessly.        This becomes vitally important when a defender is cheating toward one of        your sides. When the defender attacks your left side, you can switch        your dribble to your right side and blow by her.             Strokes take care of the rest of the action. You'll stroke left or right        to pass to one of your partners. Stroke up to jump when you don't have        the ball or to shoot when you do have the ball. If the defense is lax,        you can tap and hold on the bottom of the screen to charge your shot.        When your baller glows, stroke up to shoot the high-percentage shot.             Each character also has a special shot or slam. To perform this, you'll        need to tap a certain pattern on the touch screen twice to make the        shot. For Mario, for example, you'll need to tap five points on the        screen that make an ""M"" (bottom left, top left, bottom middle, top        right, bottom right). If you can perform this series of taps twice,        Mario makes a show-stopping unblockable shot that won't miss.       Tenacious DMario Hoops 3-on-3 is a full-contact sport. Hack        and smack your opponents to make them lose the ball and lose coins. If        projectiles are more your speed, you'll find tons of power-ups like Red        Shells and Bob-ombs on each court. Each court is special in its own way,        with some covered in ice and others tilting side to side.             When you're defending someone, slap at their ball hand by moving your        character with the Control Pad to the ball side and then stroke down        with the stylus. If you want to inflict more damage, you can stomp down        on them by stroking up to jump and stroking down to smash the ball        handler with your backside. When you smack him up, he'll lose coins,        fall to the ground and let the ball roll away from him.             When someone's driving to the hole, you can perform a spin block that        has the same effect as the stomp. More than just a block, you'll both        block the ball and smack the shooter off his feet, causing him to lose        coins.       Cool characters, cool courtsIn addition to several Mushroom        Kingdom mainstays, players can unlock several characters made famous by        the game's developer, Square-Enix. From the Final Fantasy franchise,        Moogle, Ninja and White Mage are just a few of the characters you can        recruit to your 3-on-3 team.             Probably the most striking difference between Mario Hoops 3-on-3 and        other basketball games you've played is the courts. Some have Bob-ombs        running around, others are made of ice and some have special baskets. On        one court, a Piranha Plant acts as the hoop, and it will smack anyone        who tries to dunk into its mouth. It's that kind of court creativity        that makes Mario Hoops 3-on-3 a special game with a ton of replay value.       Bottom LineWhether playing against friends on a local        wireless connection, jamming through a tournament or playing mini-games,        there’s a mode for everyone. The player models and graphics look great!        With tons of great unlockables, you'll be balling for a long time.Nintendo  "
