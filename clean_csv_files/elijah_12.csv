Konami's web-footed world-famous hero appeals to fans of all ages, male or female, with this mixture of action and puzzles.
Guiding Frogger around is a cinch thanks to his straightforward hop and dodge control - tap any direction and he'll spring towards it. Frogger also uses his tongue to swing from poles, and can bound high into the air to reach floating objects plus trigger switches or reveal passages upon landing. With moves so easy to perform, you can concentrate on solving the crazy puzzles.
There are over 30 levels to conquer, starting from the Frogger's home in Firefly Swamp, then onward via grassy hills, jungles, snowy mountains and finally through factories and the gloomy castle belonging to arch-enemy Dr Wani. Our little green champ is kept busy dodging obstacles, and employing ingenious methods to get from place to place.
Crafty designers have built the game with several routes to choose from throughout Helmet Chaos, so you'll want to explore to plunder its secrets. Yet more fun can be had from the various, hilarious, mini-games. Both PSP and DS versions have eight mini-games, one of which is exclusive to the console. These include the original 1981 arcade game, and all mini-games can be played with friends via Wi-Fi requiring only one copy of the game.

He orders a book that is  said to make its readers popular among women.  When the man opens the  book, he gets sucked into a picture book world.  In this world, he  becomes Tingle, wearing a green costume.  Tingle meets three characters  that accompany him on his journey to escape the world: Kakashi the scarecrow,  Buriki the robot, and Lion the lion.  These characters are inspired by the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion from The Wonderful  Wizard of Oz, respectively.
The player has to solve many puzzles that require the wise use of  the different abilities of Tingle's three partners. Kakashi lacks  intelligence, but is small and therefore able to get into small places.  Buriki is very intelligent, but heartless, and can cleverly solve  puzzles Tingle's other partners won't be able to do so. The party's last  member, Lion, is more powerful than the other two partners, but  cowardly. Many of the actions in the game are performed via the stylus.  Another central gameplay element is the romantic interaction with five  different female characters. The player has to find the right words  during the dialogues and to give Tingle's love interests the best  fitting items in order to win their favor. This is necessary for  continuing the adventure. In order to complete the game, Tingle must  have some degree of a relationship with all of the girls.

A few of the games are even good enough to stand on their own. You get six Midway classics from the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, so for retro gamers wanting some than just old 8-bit clunkers, this pack is jam-packed with goodness. First off is Toobin', a river runner game where players float lazily down a rapid-filled river on an inner tube. Then there's the addictive puzzler Klax that will have you sweating those rolling cubes in your nightmares. Racing fans will remember the super-fast and challenging Super Sprint, while skaters need, need, need to get their hands on the only successful translation of the immortal boarder's delight, 720 -- only the DUALSHOCK controller is able to truly duplicate the control of the arcade game. Rampage makes its presence felt with Earth-rumbling action and window-bashing carnage. But maybe the real clincher of the group is a direct translation of Smash Tv, the super-sweet, visceral, carnal shooter that could easily stand out as its own game. Using the DUALSHOCK analog controller really gives you that double-fisted gunning action of the arcade, and the graphics and sounds are all up to their ahead-of-its-time original.

I don’t want to shank it.” Earning the prestigious title of #1 Golfer of All Time can be a nerve racking process and it’s exactly what gamers will experience in Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 as they fight off more than just pressure but also the man who’s trying to claim that title for his own, Tiger Woods.    In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06, gamers will attempt to settle the old debate of just who is the #1 Golfer of All Time. They’ll play golf legends such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan on their terms and in their specific eras (equipment, clothing and all). However, Tiger Woods is also there and is after the same goal. It’s your job to find him, stop him, and ultimately supplant him as the #1 golfer of every era. Duel with Tiger in multiple matches as he becomes your nemesis, chasing and even taunting you in every tournament.    Just as it is on the PGA TOUR®, the key to a good shot is execution and precision. In Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 06 both analog sticks are used to give more control than ever over each shot. The left analog stick will continue to control the backswing and downswing, while the right analog stick, or “Shape stick”, controls ball trajectory and spin. Players are now challenged to focus on the impact point on the ball, while thinking more strategically before executing a shot. This also extends to putting where players will have to rely more on finesse and will need to move the analog stick only as far as needed to make the putt   The game of golf is as much psychological as it is physical and a key for gamers in 2006 will be maintaining confidence. With tension on every shot and mounting pressure to become the best, you can either keep your composure or lose it and become that embarrassing hack on the course. Based on good or bad shots or scores you make, a Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease based on the amount of confidence you possess.Dual Analog Swing and Putting  New advanced swing technique uses both analog sticks to “shape” shots. The left analog stick executes the swing and the right analog stick shapes the shot, controlling ball trajectory and spin. While putting, players will rely on “touch” and finesse as they swing the analog stick only as far as needed to make a putt. A new aiming mechanism also enables the user to line up and gauge putting speed.   Gamebreaker  Based on good or bad shots and scores you make, your Gamebreaker meter will increase or decrease. When you hit certain thresholds you’ll earn the opportunity to trigger a Gamebreaker situation, giving you the ability to hit a longer and more accurate shot.   Wagering and Shot Calling  Call your shot before making it and reap the rewards. Players can elect to “call their shot” before making it, putting up a wager that they can pull it off.   Courses  Play a total of 15 courses (11 licensed and three fantasy courses) including the site of the 2005 British Open, St. Andrews Golf Links. Seven new licensed courses include TPC Sawgrass (Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.) Reflection Bay (Las Vegas, Nev.), Cog Hill Golf Club (Chicago, Ill.), Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club (Portland, Ore.), Sahalee Country Club (Seattle, Was.) and Doral Golf Resort (Miami, Fla).   PGA TOUR Players  Compete as or against 15 different PGA TOUR players including Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh and new this year Chris DiMarco, Mike Weir, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald. Additionally, 12 new fantasy characters will challenge you on the links   EA SPORTS Online Competition  Play with up to four players across the country on the PlayStation 2 console or Xbox Live. Compete in Online Tournament events complete with money lists, full stat tracking, and league leaders.   Play a Career  In PGA TOUR Season mode for console versions, play along with the 52-week PGA TOUR calendar of events for up to 30 seasons. Obtain sponsorships from real golf equipment manufacturers throughout your career and drive to surpass Tiger Woods as #1 on the overall money list.   GameFace  Players will once again use the industry leading character creation technology GameFace to create their own golfer, outfit and build up their golfer’s attributes to attempt to become the #1 Golfer of All Time. New this year is the ability to choose your own voice for your character.   Reactive Tiger Proofing  The course will literally fight back. Courses will become more difficult as you score well, and will ease up if you play poorly.

Central                              to the game's single and multiplayer experience is the                              idea of a freeform battlefield, where players are given                              the freedom to choose how to complete a given objective,                              allowing for creativity and surprises, rather than heavily                              scripted events and tightly contained spaces traditionally                              used in this genre.
An advanced AI system allows NPCs to react and fight                              realistically, see and hear others, and respond as a                              team. Rogue Warrior offers a new take on the multiplayer                              experience, with 10 gameplay modes and a system whereby                              maps are created using tiles that are selected by each                              team. Rogue Warrior's tiling system allows users to                              experience over 200 maps in both day and nighttime settings.                              In addition, the campaign features solo and on-the-fly                              cooperative play for up to four players, where anyone                              can join or leave an existing campaign game at any time                              without having to go to menus or save progress.
In Rogue Warrior, you play Dick Marcinko, leader of an elite SEAL unit trapped behind enemy lines in North Korea on a covert mission to assess the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. When war breaks out between North and South Korea, you must try to lead your team back into South Korea while greatly outnumbered and with no support and limited resupply. Your journey will take you through a variety of never-before-seen environments inside of North Korea, including submarine pens, shipbreaker yards, prison camps, and more.

Sakura Wars is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based story system. An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player’s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome.
The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. Ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. Every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. Once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. For example, the hero’s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.
KEY FEATURES
 

8 chapters in total, each with 4-5 hours of gameplay.


A total of 7 characters to control.


6 different fully animated endings.


Bonus features and story after beating the game.

The game includes a new take on the License Board system, with twelve  grids available instead of one, each corresponding to a different  Zodiac sign and Job. The battle system as a whole was also tweaked;  guest characters are now controllable, while pressing the L1 button  accelerates the game's speed. Additionally, the game features English  voices and the widescreen 16:9 ratio support of the North American  version, as well as a bonus disc based on the one initially released  with the North American version. Finally, a new mode allows the player  to hunt monsters and Espers in several series of small maps, to gain  items and gil. A list of new features as below:

The Zodiac Job System – There are now 12 License Boards, each one representing a Job. Once a  character chooses that Job however, they are stuck with it throughout  the entire game. Isolated licenses can be accessed by unlocking espers  and quickenings. 
Trial Mode – The party must fight through 100 stages, each one containing stronger  monsters. Completing this mode unlocks New Game+: Weak Mode. 
Controllable Guests – Guest characters can now be controlled, and their gambits can be edited. Their equipment cannot be removed. 
Controllable Espers – Espers can now be controlled once  summoned, and their gambits can be edited. You can now use their  ultimate attack whenever you feel like it. 
Speed Boost – Pressing the L1 button speeds up the game, making getting around much easier. 
Gambit Changes – There are 16 new gambits. All the gambits can be bought upon leaving Barheim Passage. 
Item Changes – New items have been added, and some of their effects have been slightly changed. 
Enemy Changes – Enemies have been changed slightly, plus new  enemies have been added. A battle against all five Judge Magisters is  also included. 
Magick Changes – Some magic has been renamed, while others have  been moved to other categories; Brave and Faith are now White Magick  for example. Not all Magick can be bought, and some must be found in  treasure pots. 
Equipment Changes – New weapons have been added, like the Excalipoor,  while others have been slightly changed. Armor and accessories have  also been slightly changed. Some weapons have different elemental  alignments. 
Shop Listings – Some shops have had their inventory changed. 
Mist Knack (Quickening) Changes – Mist knacks no longer take up MP. Instead, they have their own Mist gauge. 
MP Changes – Since Mist Knacks do not use MP now, obtaining  Mist Knacks does not increase MP. Instead, characters simply get more MP  as they level up. Max MP is determined by your job. 
New Game+ – Two New Game+ modes are available. Strong Mode,  where all characters begin at level 90, and Weak Mode, where all  characters begin at level 1 and never level up. Nothing carries over  into these new save files. 
Treasure Respawns – Treasures pots now respawn by just moving one screen away. 
Treasure Item Changes - Some items inside coffers have been switched around, added, or removed. 
Break Damage Limit – There is no damage limit any more. If a  character does more than 9,999 damage, the game will show it. Against  very weak enemies, it is possible to achieve over 100,000 HP of damage  with a single attack.

Ultimate carnage: The peerless real world physics engine combines vehicles built from over 40 deformable parts with over 8000 destructible objects per track. Arcade destruction racing at its best!
Thrilling racing: Race against 12 highly competitive drivers over 39 tracks in 6 different environments. Choose any one of 48 cars, and wreck your way across parched deserts, massive storm drains, and narrow city streets.
Game modes: Become the ultimate FlatOut Champion by competing in three progressively tougher classes, or just go wild in Deathmatch Destruction Derbies, challenges, and time trials.

The Ragdoll: The Ragdoll is unique to FlatOut. Catapult him through your windscreen or, even better, the other drivers' windscreens as they wreck out of the race. Have fun with 12 Ragdoll mini-events including High Jump, Stone Skipping, Ring of Fire, Field Goal, and Free Kick.
Next-gen graphics: See every scratch and dent with real-time environment mapping creating a grittier realistic appearance. Dynamic shadow maps are provided for every 3-D object on the track including buildings, scenery, and cars, making all movement exceptionally smooth. The scenery is so realistic, watch out, you don't want to get distracted!

The crafty minds behind some of the most clever adventure games on PC (including the Monkey Island series and the beloved Sam and Max Hit the Road) have unsheathed their daggers and commandeered all the booty from the PlayStation 2 in the making of their latest adventure game. Escape From Monkey Island, the fourth and most recent chapter in the series, buckles its swash in this hysterical and challenging adventure game. The heroic Guybrush Threepwood returns to Melee Island to find his new bride endangered, his long-time nemesis Chuck LeChuck digging deeply into a brand new diabolical plot, and a big ol' ship-load of monkeys bumbling all about. Each seemingly useless item has a bizarre use for those clever enough to solve the game's riddles, so think twice before you try using your Pirate's Grog, your Old Cologne, or your...er, your duck. Lush animated visuals sway in the breeze of a flurry of puns, gags, one-liners, and jokes in this witty puzzler, as Guybrush valiantly trots off into adventure seeking a way to stop the forces scheming against him from unleashing the power of a terrible new weapon...the Ultimate Insult!

Soon thereafter, they discover a means of harnessing this energy        in a weapon called a ""Glade."" A Glade emits a sound when it hits        something.
Fighters and entertainers quickly realized the potential of grapping, as        the music generated by the clashing Glades in combat provided an        experience that couldn't be matched in any other sport.

In this mode you will only control the first lady, while the second is controlled by the cpu. After each match you earn skill points which you use to improve your partner's skills. The world tour is the main singleplayer mode and will keep you busy for a while.

Two hundred persistent Captains that are able to do everything the player can, including forming dynamic factions, building structures, controlling territory, and going to War.
A true living galaxy that is not player centric. It will develop differently each game through the interactions of the agents.
Build your own faction from nothing.
Randomly generated modular parts. Build the mothership that suits your play style, on the fly, in seconds. Every part has its own unique stats that contribute to the mothership. Every part has its own hull integrity and damage states. Every part is a real, working, ship component.
Strategic ship building. The mass, location and shape of parts all matter. If a part blocks a turret, it will not fire. If a ship is too long, it will turn slowly. Too many engines will mean too little power for weapons. Every design choice counts.
A fully physics based 3d environment where everything is destructible, takes damage from impacts, can be grabbed and even thrown at enemies with the tractor beam.
Natural movement and controls. Movement is on a 2d plane and screen relative, much like an FPS. The combat feels like huge pirate ships battling on an ocean. Focus on tactical positioning and manage system power to unleash hell at the right moment.
Epic ship to ship battles. Tear the enemy apart piece by piece over minutes, instead of seconds.

Geoff, meanwhile, dreams of proving his worth and earning citizenship of his own. But he would soon discover that life wasn't as simple as he once thought.
It began suddenly - selection and survival. Alliances were tested, strained, broken. The world was changing, evolving, and Geoff would stand as a central figure in the upheaval.
He would have to confront... the Natural Doctrine.

Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is the 3rd installment in the Marvel Vs. Capcom series of games.  The series began with X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter.
Marvel Vs. Capcom has newcomers such as Megaman, Jin, Captain Commando, Strider Hiryu, Roll, Venom, and War Machine.
The Dreamcast, and Arcade versions of the game allow tagging mid battle, and the match ending only after both characters on a single team are KO'd, or the time runs out.
New, and unique to Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heros is the Duo team attack, where both characters on a single team enter the battle feild to fight together.  This feature, however does not return to the sequel.
Also, unlike it's sequel, Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes features 6 attack buttons. Light Medium, and Heavy punches and kicks.  Like the 2 games before it, it also allows ariel combat, and a unique, easy to use, but, hard to master combo system.
Characters all have their strengths, and weaknesses.  It may not be the most balanced fighting game around, as Hulk, for example can eleminate a character with a single, none infinity combo.  He is the only character in the game to KO a character without an infinity combo, however, not including secret characters.
This game is a must have if you like capcom games and/or fighting games, or comic super heroes.  Although the Dreamcast's Directional pad can get in the way of complex game play.  Be sure to use a Play Station 2 controller adapter, or Dreamcast Arcade controller. "

One of the best-selling series in the history of video games, the Tom Clancy games have developed a devout following of fans. The games feature authentic military weapons, tactics, and locations, and an immersive game play experience.
The Ghost Recon series is based on squad-level military strategy, where you control a squad of soldiers to complete each operation. The Splinter Cell games, featuring NSA Black Ops agent Sam Fisher, require stealth and planning to complete each mission. The Rainbow Six series, based on the Clancy novel of the same name, focuses more on tactics and stealth than sheer firepower.
Now's your chance to play three classic Tom Clancy titles for the low price of $39.99 (suggested retail price).
 

Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon™: War has broken out on the borders of Russia, and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. That's when the call goes out for the Ghosts—an elite handful of specially trained U.S. Army Green Berets, armed with the latest technology and trained to use the deadliest weapons. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell® introduced a new type of game to the Clancy lineup: a third-person stealth action game with cyber-terrorism, shadow agencies, and covert operations on the menu. In Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® 3, the third installment in the wildly popular Rainbow Six series and first endeavor onto next-generation platforms, Team Rainbow races against time to stop terror and prevent an impending war.

These often complement each other and form a pleasing yet obvioulsy different atmosphere while playing.

The game’s action-oriented battle system lets players use powerful        “Energy Bonbons” against their enemies. Using just the Nunchuk, players        can manipulate an Energy Bonbon’s trajectory in a number of different        ways. All of Opoona’s commands are also controlled by the Nunchuk, to        allow a complete “single-hand control” of the game.
 
Opoona is not just about battling; it is a “Lifestyle RPG.” As Opoona,        players must adapt to a new environment, meet new people, and contribute        to society through work, all while becoming aware of the precious world        and people around him. As the game progresses, Opoona will develop        relationships and uncover a broader range of activities including new        jobs and clues to new adventures. "

There is only one spectator sport left, BLAST CHAMBER. Take the role of one of the nameless contestants raised by the Stable and see if you can get out alive. In the allotted time of The Game, you must make your way through a rotating chamber to a crystal. Otherwise, the bomb strapped to your back is going to explode. Not everyone is successful, and at some point, your remains are going to decorate one of the 60 levels. To spread the fear of time, challenge your friends to an Eliminator match, in which the last man standing wins, or a Free for All, he who dies least, wins. Whoever can survive the BLAST CHAMBER just might win his freedom.
Your mission is simple You're going to be thrown into a chamber with a load of highly explosive C4 strapped to your body. The countdown begins as you scramble, both against opponents and in solo-player modes, through a rotating, obstacle-laced, lethal chamber. Your goal is to snag the crystal, gain control of the game, and stay alive. Lose control and you're toast.
Battle your way through 60 dynamic and explosive chambers as you race against the clock! You will compete for your life in multiple gameplay modes, both as a solo player and in multi-player struggles. Face off against the clock or struggle to send your opponent into oblivion with 3 different gameplay modes and 2 challenging tournament options:
Solo Survivor: You will advance, as a single player, through 40 progressively difficult chambers in a predetermined order before time runs out. Place your crystal in the score zone to survive and advance to the next chamber. Fail and you're cat food.
Eliminator: Battle against up to 3 other players in a competition that will take you through 20 totally different and challenging chambers. Winner is the last one alive. Losers are hosed off the walls.
Free-For-All: This is a two to four player mode that pits you against your opponents in 20 totally twisted chambers. You will battle for a fixed period of time...when players explode, they are miraculously returned to the chamber, but have lost a life. The player who dies the fewest number of times wins. We recommend you try not to die at all.
Tournament Modes: There are tournament modes for both Eliminator and Free-for-All games. Battle to the death. "

Have you ever wondered what could happen if time travel was a reality? Have you ever thought about the possibility of going back in time to rewrite history for the better? That possibility is a reality in the first-person shooter Darkest of Days developed by Phantom EFX and 8monkey Labs.
In Darkest of Days, travel back and forth through the annals of time to relive some of mankind's most dire hours, when human society was at its lowest points. By fighting through terrible events such as The Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest conflict of the Civil War, and both World War I and II, attempt to save certain key individuals who were never meant to become involved in these truly monstrous events and thereby change human history for the better.




Brand new engine: The dedicated team at 8monkey Labs has created an all-new, groundbreaking game engine known as Marmoset. Fight through epic battles filled with literally hundreds of non-player characters (NPCs) on the screen at the same time, all with an advanced AI and all without a hint of graphical slowdown and all set against wide-open environments that are lushly detailed and dynamically lighted.
Compelling storyline: Darkest of Days is a compelling, action-packed first-person shooter, but it's not just mindless run-and-gun, blow 'em up gameplay. Think about how to approach certain key battles and situations, and take care when fighting -- certain key people that were never meant to die will be marked with a special blue aura. If you kill them, you'll face dire consequences ...
Future weapons in antiquity: Bring a futuristic weapon back through history and kick some major butt. How differently would Custer's last stand have turned out if the General was equipped with an M-16 assault rifle? While not every battle and situation will allow you to wield weapons from the future, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to unleash futuristic fury on your unsuspecting foes.

There are still some great ones every now and then, such as Call of Duty 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but even the best WWII games are getting dangerously close to having their top-notch gameplay overshadowed by the ""been there, done that"" feeling you get from doing the same or similar missions over and over again. There's no great gameplay to be found in Medal of Honor: Vanguard, so there's nothing to hide those feelings of déjà vu that you'll get when you play it. Nearly everything in the game has been done before, and it has all been done better. Step 1: Kill Nazi soldiers. Step 2: Do it again. Vanguard places you in the role of Frank Keegan, a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne division. Each mission is set up with a bit of black-and-white footage narrated by Keegan, followed by a brief cutscene once the mission starts. It's the same basic story from previous games, and you're not likely to give it a second thought. There are four campaigns, each of which is divided into two to four missions. You'll be fighting in Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Germany, doing just what you'd expect to be doing in a WWII FPS. You'll plant charges on enemy antiaircraft weapons, procure documents, rescue missing soldiers, clear bunkers, use bazookas on tanks, and shoot a ton of Nazis. You'll get to do a little bit of parachuting here and there, but there's nothing to it--you have a tiny bit of control over where you land, and it doesn't matter a whole lot where you end up. There's no online play to speak of. This isn't a huge shock on the Wii, but considering that other Medal of Honor games for the PS2 have had online play, its omission is notable. You can play some split-screen multiplayer if you'd like, but come on--this is 2007, not 1997. Even if you can look past the clichéd mission objectives, there's plenty of other issues to bring you down. Enemy artificial intelligence is atrocious. Nazi soldiers exhibit no advanced tactics, unless you count ducking their heads back behind cover for a few seconds after bullets whiz past as an advanced tactic. Even if they do seek some sort of cover, they'll just stick their heads back out in a few seconds so you can shoot them. The soldiers you fight with are just as brain-dead, and it's almost comical to watch your group fight the enemy--everyone's in plain sight, but nobody's hitting anything. One of the biggest problems is horrible hit detection for bullets. It routinely takes two or three shots to register a hit, if it registers at all. Most weapons have terrible range, so you've got to get pretty close to your target to get a kill. Nazi soldiers don't seem to have this problem and can easily hit you from any distance, through even the smallest openings. It makes it pretty tough to find cover when you can't see who is shooting you, or even discern the enemy's general location. You don't have a health bar, but your screen grows red as you get hit, so you've got to take cover to regain health. Even this system, which has been used in countless other games, doesn't work very well. You're frequently given very little warning that you're getting hit and near death; sometimes just one or two seconds pass from the first shot to the last. All of these problems are at their worst near the end, when the developer tried to make up for the game's brevity (you can beat it in about six to eight hours) by making the last two missions ridiculously difficult. The checkpoints are few and far between, and you're getting shot from all angles. It's extremely frustrating and not much fun. Like most of the other first-person shooters on the Wii, Vanguard has been saddled with lackluster controls. The basic controls are fine, and being able to look around corners is a nice touch. Once you get a hang of aiming and looking around with the Wii Remote, you'll find that it offers much more precision than the PS2's analog sticks. But because many of your moves are mapped to the hard-to-reach face buttons of the remote, you'll find yourself accidentally moving the remote and thereby altering your aim when you try to change weapons or select a grenade. Don't even bother trying to move the remote forward to melee--you almost always mess up your aim and miss. You move around by using the Nunchuk's analog stick, and this works well. The problems come with the more advanced controls. The Nunchuk's buttons are used to change your stance from prone to crouching to standing, but you can also do this by moving the Nunchuk up or down. It doesn't take much movement to make this happen, and you'll often wind up crouching or standing up at very inopportune times. You can turn 180 degrees by moving the Nunchuk quickly to the left, but if you move it to the right, you reload your weapon. Needless to say, mixing these two up is an easy and often fatal mistake. Thanks to some muddy graphics, it's often difficult to figure out who's shooting you. Medal of Honor: Vanguard looks pretty much like every other WWII game out there, though it looks a little better on the Wii compared to the PS2 version, thanks to widescreen and 480p support. The frame rate isn't all that fast, but it's usually consistent, slowing down only when things get really hectic. You'll fight in bombed-out villages, fields, and churches, as well as inside war-torn homes. Most of these locations aren't very interesting, though there are some nice touches here and there, like when you look up in the sky and see it filled with paratroopers. Very little of the environments are destructible, and outside of some decent-looking smoke, the effects aren't much to get excited about. There are lots of browns, grays, and greens, which makes it hard to discern enemy soldiers from their surroundings unless they're firing their weapons. There are some decent enemy death animations, but they often take place a full second or two late, which makes them look quite silly. Probably the game's best aspect is its audio. You'll recognize the main theme from previous Medal of Honor games, and the orchestral soundtrack kicks in when the action gets intense. The game's sound effects are good, and while the voice acting isn't remarkable, it is helpful. Your fellow soldiers will warn you to get down when you're getting shot and even point out enemy locations from time to time. With so many World War II games already on the market, just being average isn't enough anymore. In many ways, Medal of Honor: Vanguard isn't even average; it does too many simple things poorly and does nothing particularly well. There's really no reason to pick it up on the PlayStation 2, and thanks to a higher price tag for the Wii version, there's very little reason to buy it for the Wii, either. "

Any mind, any time. For years, the Psychonauts have deployed their psychically-armed operatives all over the world, but this time trouble is brewing right in their own backyard. Someone is abducting students from the Psychonaut boot camp-a deranged scientist who only wants their brains. One cadet-a mysterious and powerful new arrival named Raz-stands alone against the lunatic. Raz must develop and unleash an arsenal of paranormal powers and his most powerful weapon of all-the ability to launch himself telepathically into someone else's mind, and run around in the demented amusement park of their imagination. Ultimately he must enter the mind of his worst enemy and destroy his dark plans at their source, while trying not to lose his sanity in the process.

Embark on a third-person psychic odyssey through thirteen incredibly unique levels: three set in the real world, and ten set inside the mental worlds of misfits, monsters and madmen  
Rise up in rank as you collect figments of other people's imaginations, sort their emotional baggage, clear out their mental cobwebs, and crack open their memory vaults  
Complete special training missions to learn the power of Levitation and the ability to focus Raz' mental energy into a powerful PSI-Blast  
Rank up to earn more psychic powers such as Telekinesis (toss enemies or objects with your mind), Invisibility (convince your foes they can't see you), Pyrokinesis (set the world on fire), Clairvoyance (see through the eyes of another), and Confusion (cloud the minds of your enemies, play tricks on your friends)  
Put your thoughts to use-Raz can grab the thought bubble over his head and pull it down around himself as a shield, hang from it like a hot air balloon, or jump on top of it and ride it around like a skateboard.  
Interact with a multitude of dynamic environmental features, such as tightropes, trapezes, ladders, poles, ledges, trampolines, climbing walls and rail slides.  
Non-linear gameplay with incredible depth offers players multiple paths and sub-challenges (digging up PSItanium arrowheads, finding lost brains, telekinetic canoeing, and winning the psychic scavenger hunt) so there is always a goal to accomplish  
Immersive story injected with lots of humor features vivid characters and a range of unique and wildly imaginative environments  
Challenging puzzles span a range of difficulty, with alternate solutions that self-tailor themselves to the player's own strengths and abilities  
Created by Tim Schafer, the visionary designer of award winning titles including Grim Fandango and Full Throttle

Gamers live the life of Beowulf, the legendary Norse warrior with the strength of 30 men who is torn between the nobility and brutality within him. Arrogant, self-serving and lustful for gold and glory, Beowulf will journey to Denmark to destroy a bloodthirsty beast wreaking havoc on a frigid land. But evil persists, and Beowulf succumbs to its lure of even greater fame, quietly maneuvering to claim the Danish throne. As King, Beowulf must face the consequences of ambition, even as war descends on the realm. As Beowulf, players lead their men, called thanes, into battle, slay the Titans of a dying age and crush the enemies that threaten to annihilate both their kingdom and people. Only then, when Beowulf looks Destiny in the eye, will he know what kind of hero he has truly become. “Ubisoft, Paramount Pictures and Shangri-La Entertainment have been working extremely close in developing Beowulf,” said Gilles Matouba, creative director at Ubisoft. “From the very beginning, we have had an unprecedented level of access to information and assets from the movie. This access, coupled with the creative and technological abilities of our team, has allowed us to capture aspects of the film and translate them perfectly into compelling gameplay elements such as the visceral hand-to-hand combat, dynamic swordplay and amazing visuals, while giving us the creative liberty to go even further by creating exclusive content for the game that is unexplored by the film and even the classic tale.” Key features:

Delve even deeper into the adventure as gamers will play through 30 years of the Beowulf story not seen in the movie to experience more of Beowulf’s life and mold their own legacy. 
The mystical world of Beowulf comes to life in stunning fashion. Powered by the next evolution of the award-winning YETI technology used to create the critically acclaimed Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Beowulf delivers an unrivalled graphical experience. 
Army of up to 12 thanes to unlock as players increase their heroic experience (by saving thanes, killing giant monsters, etc.). 
Players use the thane army to their advantage by giving orders, assigning positions, tailoring weapons to the situation or enemy and by triggering in-game mechanisms. 
The thane army evolves with upgradeable weapons (swords, mace and spears), skills and abilities. 
Use legacy experience points to gain thanes, replace weapons and upgrade Carnal abilities. 
Carnal Power allows the use of stronger attacks and special weapons. Carnal upgrades include less daze after use and prolonged use of Carnal Fury. But if used too much, there will be grave consequences. 
Dynamic combat system including combos, parries and increasing skills as the player progresses. 
Grab ability allows Beowulf to hold on to walls or climb, as well as fight up close with visceral hand-to-hand combat against enemies and giant monsters.

Players can roam around the world field and make action movements like in an action game, but once you enterbattle you engage the enemy using a turn-based system.
Battle System
During battle, different body parts can be targeted to disable the enemy. For instance, attacks to the legs will slow them down, while blows to the arms will weaken their attacks. By strategically striking key areas of the body, players can strip the enemy of their ability to fight.
Setting
There are 2 main characters in Last Rebellion, Nine (male) and Aisha (female). Nine is a Blade, whose specialty is physical attacks, and Aisha is a Sealer, who uses magic spells to attack & seal enemies. The player can switch back and forth between the two during the battle. Since Nine and Aisha share a single, the player must strategically choose which character to execute their attacks first. Because of this, Last Rebellion is no ordinary RPG with another mindless battle system. The player must be aware of which enemies they are fighting against, and use their experience and strategy throughout the game.
Features

Tactical battle system with interchangeable main characters


Attractive, visual characters with lots of personality


Gorgeous watercolor-like character art and event scenes

To save the day, you’ll have to build settlements that will stand up to the attacks of the marauding Clockwork Army, as well as prove your worth as a warrior on the battlefield.
Lock lives with his grandfather in a seaside village and dreams of one day becoming a famous Archineer. To fulfill his ambition, he’ll have to fine-tune the skills his mysterious elder taught him and aid in his people’s battle with the Clockwork Army by building traps, walls, weapons and other defences to protect the precious artefacts housed within the kingdom.
It’s up to you to guide him on his quest, balancing the need to create expensive towers that will stand up to stronger attacks with the important task of spreading your defensive havens far and wide. How you choose to build on the Touch Screen will dictate how the game pans out, with your decisions creating a unique game experience every time you play.
As well as constructing safe and secure villages, you’ll take charge of Lock as he switches from Archineer to warrior and battles against the Clockwork Army on the frontline. Special moves to mow down the enemy can be activated on the Touch Screen, and once you’ve laid the robots to ruin you can salvage scrap metal and use it to make essential repairs to your constructions.
Once you’re satisfied your Archineering skills are up to scratch, you can challenge a friend who also has a copy of the game and wage war to see how your friend’s strategy skills measure up to yours.
Archineer the perfect strategy to save your kingdom and become both defensive mastermind and potent attacking force.

Ward off invading robots by creating defense structures on 100 different map areas and step into combat to help protect what you’ve built.
Use the Nintendo DS Touch Screen and stylus to build your defences and trigger special moves in combat.

Put Adult Swim alchemy in the palm of your hand.
For Edward to possess the Philosopher's Stone, he has to go through the        evil Homunculi in the first Fullmetal adventure for Nintendo DS!
Features

 Six playable characters: Edward or Alphonse Elric, Roy Mustang, Alex          Louis Armstrong, Izumi and Scar 
 Perform devastating melee and combo attacks 
 Release powerful alchemy attacks with the Nintendo DS touch screen 
 Explore the Fullmetal Alchemist story that features the same voice          cast from the Cartoon Network TV series 
 More than 10 touch screen mini-games, including “Whack-A-Homunculus”          and “Fullmetal vs. Flame” 
 Tons of unlockable content including talking character alarms, image          galleries, and video and sound libraries 

Who knew science kicked so much butt? Brawling is the formula for        Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy, a side-scrolling action game that        puts players in the role of Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, on a        journey to combat the evil Homunculi and acquire the fabled        Philosopher’s Stone.
Alchemy might be hard, but controlling Fullmetal Alchemist is easy. You        press A to attack and B to jump. Players can execute different attack        combos, but make no mistake: the game's formula calls for tons of        brawling.
The most valuable attacks come from the DS touch screen. Each of the six        playable characters have special attacks, and to activate them, all        you'll need to do is touch the appropriate icon on the touch screen.        Edward, for example, can put up walls and produce an explosion from a        cannon. To activate these attacks, you'll just need to touch the        respective icon.
As you fight through each level, you'll occasionally come across        touch-screen challenges. You won't need to do this on-the-fly, which is        important to note. The game will stop and let you prepare for the        challenge. In one challenge, for example, you'll need to untie a        kidnapped person.
Bottom LineAlthough this game will mainly appeal to Fullmetal        Alchemist fans, those who like brawlers should give it a look.

When war broke out between the world's two main superpowers, the Guylos Empire and the Republic of Helic, the effects rippled across the globe, dragging other nations into the fight. Two such nations were Maroll and Jamil. During the war, Maroll's attacks on the neighboring Jamil were devastating, and even a decade after the war had ended, Jamil's economy and infrastructure hadn't fully recovered. Animosity, paranoia, and mutual mistrust between the two nations hindered their ability to find common ground and complete their peace talks. For ten long years, the two nations found themselves in the middle of a cold war.
Now, in Zoids Assault, after a mysterious explosion at one of Maroll's military bases, two covert ops teams are sent into Jamil territory, their exact mission details never disclosed. Somehow, the events of the present are inextricably linked to the past, to the final days of the war, ten years ago.




Command a Zoid army: Take control of a fleet of giant biomechanical life forms that blend the assets of beast and machine to create fierce weapons of war.
Advanced military tactics: Facing armies that far outnumber you means optimizing your tactical advantages. Mastering the concentrated fire tactic, managing the scan gauge and support tactics, and utilizing the Electromagnetic Pulse System will be crucial to your survival.
First-class customization: Take your units to the next level with upgrades, including melee weapons, rockets, rifles, machine guns, shotguns, cannons, and more.

One night, without warning, denizens of the netherworld emerged and slaughtered the kingdom; nary a soul was left alive.

Within an abandoned, long-forgotten church deep in the woods, a wisp is set free.  Bereft of memory, it is drawn toward the monster-infested castle and re-awakens the souls of the vanquished knights, leading them back towards the fallen stronghold to confront the very forces of evil that took their lives...

Not easily placed in any one genre, the game requires players to throw out everything they know about roleplaying and strategy games and embrace something altogether new and fresh.  Frantic, energetic action mixes with thought-provoking tactical gameplay, all within a beautifully-rendered fantasy setting and presented through a captivating, emotional narrative. "

Both games -- The Lost & Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony -- offer expansive, story-based experiences inside this wild and dangerous city. The package does not require a copy of the original Grand Theft Auto IV to play.

THE LOST AND DAMNED -- Johnny is a veteran member of The Lost, a notorious biker gang. Johnny has been creating business opportunities for The Lost in Liberty City, but his first loyalty must be to the patch he wears on his back and to Billy Grey, the club's President. However, when Billy returns from rehab hell-bent on bloodshed and debauchery, Johnny finds himself in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs for control of a city torn apart by violence and corruption. Can the brotherhood survive? 

THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY -- Grand Theft Auto IV's second downloadable episode injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz, and grime. As Luis Lopez, part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince (aka ""Gay Tony""), players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price.

Welcome to the zaniest ballpark ever!
Choose from a variety of multiplayer mini-games to play with your        favorite pros and challenge each other to baseball’s wacky versions of        golf, bocce, piñata, and other original games.

 Baseball Bocce - Grab your Wii Remote and take turns using an          underhand throwing motion to get your ball as close to the jack (white          ball) as possible. Watch out for gophers, lawnmowers, and other          obstacles that can block your path. 
 Wall O Bricks - Smash the Wall O Bricks with your bat and avoid          the Behemoth! Players will swing the Wii Remote like a baseball bat to          knock out bricks and earn power-ups. 
 Snack Cannon - The fans are hungry and they’re letting you know          it. Can you feed them all in time? Look at the bubble above a fan’s          head to see what kind of snack he wants. Aim and launch the correct          food at the fans to earn points. 
 Baseball Golf - Bat, bunt, and toss the ball to sink it in the          hole in the fewest strokes possible! Multiple Wii Remote motions will          be used to complete a hole. Swinging motions for drives, throwing for          mid range shots and once on the green you’ll utilize a bunting motion          to finish off the hole. 
 Marbles - Try to knock marbles out of the circle in this          baseball themed take on a classic childhood game! Hold the B Button          and perform an under-arm throwing motion with your Wii Remote. Release          the B Button when you wish to release the ball. 
 Batting Range - Don’t want to play a full game of Baseball          Golf? Work on your swing at the Batting Range! 
 Pachinko - Bat balls into the stands and try to earn prizes on          the biggest pachinko board around. The baseballs you’ve collected can          be spent in Pachinko to earn prizes such as bats, balls, shirts and          more which can then be equipped in your player’s locker! 
 Piñata Smash - As you play the different mini games, you          can win Piñatas. These Piñatas are needed to play the Piñata Smash          mini game. You’ve got 30 seconds to swing the Wii Remote to smash the          Piñata and reveal the prizes within. 
 Trophy Room - Head on into the Trophy Room to see the prizes          you have won by completing and winning the mini games. 
 Locker Room - Here you can equip your character with all of the          unlockable gear you’ve discovered along the way! The gear is broken          down into categories: headgear, clothing and equipment. 
 Mascot Dance - Think you’ve got the moves? Play with Wally the          Green Monster, Fredbird, Mr. Met, or Phillie Phanatic. Perform for the          crowd and show them what you’ve got. Mimic the gestures on screen with          the Nunchuk and Wii Remote to earn points before time runs out.
