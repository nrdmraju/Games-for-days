This Is the Police is a strategy/adventure game set in a city spiraling the drain. You’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg as gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd (portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem).
Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigues. You are taking the role of Police Chief Jack Boyd – you’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack see his retirement with a nice sum of money waiting to be spend or will he end up broken … or even worse?
Immerse yourself in a controversial tale of corruption, crime, and political intrigue. Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.
Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg? Or will you land yourself behind bars — or worse?











Your mission is clear: Make 500.000$ in 180 days, before Jack Boyd goes to retirement. How? Up to you!
Decisions, decisions, decisions – This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, it will influence your game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.
The Good, the Bad … the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg’s Police Department is dealing with all kind of people. It is up to you, to sort out the bad boys.
Follow your duties: As head of Freeburg PD, Jack has to take care of the daily routine – responding to emergencies, managing his officers, fighting for budget …
Start and solve Investigations and get evidence against the criminal gangs in Freeburg.
Deal with the different powers of the city: The Mayor, the Mafia, the Church, the Labor Union: everyone offers you a favor, but everything has its price …
Rich and fully voice acted story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by the glorious Jon St. John (aka the voice of Duke Nukem)

Worms is a cleverly-balanced turn-based strategy game in which teams of worms battle across bizarre randomly-generated landscapes for supremacy.
Each team takes it in turns to pick off the opposing teams using crazy weapons, tools and other utilities and whatever foul strategies they can devise.
Worms die when they lose all of their energy or plunge into the water. The winning team is the one that manages to survive the mayhem and have worms left standing when the dust settles. Sound simple? Easy to play but difficult to master, it’s a game of deep strategy that belies its simple appearance.




A cleverly balanced mix of strategy and arcade action that while simple and easy to understand, contains real depth and massive replay-ability
Offline turn-based play for up to 4 players
Online turn-based play for up to 4 players over Live
An assortment of game options, from the landscape on which to battle on, to turn time, round time, and the starting weapon arsenal of each team. 
3 detailed tutorials to introduce the mechanics to those who’ve not played the game before
20 increasingly difficult single player challenges
3 graphical themes on which to play
A random landscape generator meaning no two landscapes generated are ever the same
22 weapons and utilities to deploy against your enemies
A large amount of customization: from worm and team names, to what they say and gravestone they leave behind when they die.

The Joy-Con™ (L) and Joy-Con™ (R) produce different sounds, and swinging them together creates a cymbal crash. The game can also be played with a Pro Controller, but no matter how you choose to jam, you’ll be creating awesome drum lines in no time. By fashioning your own beats to the game’s library of songs, you’ll earn metal power that can be turned against the aliens.
•Jam Your WayA new spin on traditional music gameplay, Gal Metal eschews predetermined musical notes and lets the player create their own drumlines based on over a dozen beats. Practice the beats in your club room after school and wrack up unique combos to blow the aliens away in live performances.
•Unique StorytellingDivided up into episodes ending in climactic concerts, the lighthearted story of Gal Metal unfolds in animated manga panels and text messages brimming with personality. The manga reads right-to-left for an authentically Japanese experience.
•Be an After-School SpecialistIn between performances to take on the pesky aliens, you’ll manage your own life as a student. Improve your skills and friendships by doing part-time jobs, hanging out with your friends, and jamming in the club room.
•Show Your True MettleWhile the basic gameplay of Gal Metal is simple to learn, players who master the beats can earn millions of points by creating complex performances. How much metal power can you score?

THE FIRST ACTION-RPG in the world of Warhammer 40,000
Set in the dystopian 41st millennium, Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr places the Inquisitors of the grim future into an Action-RPG and pits them against heretics, mutants, treacherous xenos and the daemons of the Chaos Gods.
Your mission is to purge the unclean and protect the Imperium from corruption!
 
BECOME AN INQUISITOR
INQUISITORS ARE POWERFUL SECRET AGENTS
Inquisitors are the fearsome and legendary secret agents of the Imperium with a wide range of unique skills, huge influence and deadly firepower. They come from diverse backgrounds and they specialize in different areas.
THEIR TASK IS DAUNTING, THEIR VIGIL IS ENDLESS.
EXPANDING THE BOUNDARIES
THE NEXT MILESTONE IN THE EVOLUTION OF ACTION-RPGS
Inquisitor – Martyr is an open-world sandbox Action-RPG set in the Caligari Sector, a secluded region of the Imperium with hundreds of star systems, thousands of planets, which offers a huge variety of mission types on randomly generated maps: a persistent universe with special mini-campaigns and a storyline influenced by the community.
THERE IS ONLY WAR
A MONUMENTAL AND BRUTAL EXPERIENCE
True to the spirit of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the gameplay incorporates tactical elements like the cover-based combat, a brand new AI and controllable vehicles, not to mention the spectacular display of destruction where attacks noticeably affect the environment.
BLOOD AND GORE
BRUTAL FIGHTS WITH A TACTICAL LAYER
Battles are not only vicious and bloody, but the more challenging fights just got some extra flavor.
Aimed attacks at giant foes can destroy body parts, getting rid of the special abilities, not to mention the rewarding and special execution moves to finish off the bosses.
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS
COMMUNITY-BASED GAMEPLAY
In addition to the single-player Story Mode, the Inquisitorial Campaign not only introduces the cooperative gameplay up to 4 players, but gives you the chance to join various Inquisitorial clans.
Participate in unique World Events and go on unique chains of missions that could influence the fate of the whole sector.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

The show takes off when evil forces begin trying to turn the two peaceful races against each other. A war looks inevitable, but a wise old dragon named Beaucephalis identifies 16-year old Artha Penn as a potential saviour. And so, together, they work to regain understanding between the humans and dragons, while investigating the evil at work behind the scenes.
As with the TV show, all the events in Dragon Booster for Nintendo DS take place in Dragon City, during the prelude to the Dragon/Human war.
There are two modes available. Adventure mode is mission-based, and puts you in the centre of the Libris Alliance Story. Challenge mode is where you get to explore Dragon City in search of dragons to collect, train, and breed for racing. You can own a maximum of 12 dragons, but can trade with friends via the Nintendo DS wireless link to get the ones you want. If you want to race against your friends, go right ahead using the same wireless connection.

He has been  petrified for three years, though.  		With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he's  actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last  wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is  flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the  handle and who is Robert's love with a capital L, by the way. A final  ray of hope is provided by the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know  more about Robert's destiny than Robert himself...

This enigmatic organization plans to unleash a lethal computer virus that can disable any computer in the world. One false step, however, and the secretary will disavow any knowledge ... you know the drill.Features 

Third-person adventure with emphasis on stealth 
Choose different paths to complete your objectives 
Emphasis on the details. Carry a decommissioned guard to a door and use his hand to activate a biometric ID reader 
Highly detailed environments and characters put you right in the game. 

In Operation Surma, you won't stumble across an unholy arsenal of cutting-edge weapons to blast your enemies to high heaven. Noise draws unwanted attention to your efforts. Ethan instead prefers silent-but-deadly stealth. Big guns aren't really needed, because Ethan can silently and swiftly disptach a man with his bare hands.Where Operation Surma lacks in weapons it makes up in gadgets second only to those of that 00 guy from England. The gadget players will use the most is the Electronic Lock Pick, which allows you to hack into the Surma security systems. Set off an alarm? No problem, hack into the nearest alarm disabler. This gives the all-clear that the intruder has been captured. There's nothing like giving the hapless guards a false sense of security to give you more confidence.Ethan's IMF contact lenses display a level map at the screen's bottom left and give Ethan night-vision capabilities to see electronic alarm tripwires and other traps that lie concealed lurk in the gloom. The Electronic War Gun disables surveillance cameras and creates distractions to lure guards from their posts.All the gadgets in the world, however, can't help Ethan move undetected from shadow to shadow and take out Surma guards. That's your job. The shadows has different shades, making finding the darkest ones vital. With the help of a stealth meter and a 360-degree view, you hide Ethan in dark corners, then sneak out and surprise unsuspecting guards with quick strikes. You don't want to leave a body in plain view of a security camera, so you'll often need to dump the evidence in the shadows.Running and gunning is sometimes a good tactic, but don't overuse it. In an unusual twist, Ethan can try to get the upper hand against Surma by forming uneasy alliances with unsavory characters.IMF computer expert Luther Stickell (voiced by Ving Rhames) feeds objectives to Ethan and shows the next objective's location on the map. The interaction between Luther and Ethan can be a bit clunky at times (at one climactic moment, Luther sounds as excited as a wet rag), but Luther is one sharp computer whiz.Overall, the tale of espionage has more twists and turns than ten roller coasters. You get assassination, disguises, and more. Is there a mole in the team?The learning curve for the controls is a short. Operation Surma does a good job of challenging you to think of alternative ways to tackle a sticky situation. If you have a hankering for stealth, you'll want to slip into the shadows with this addictive third-person adventure. "

Someone killed rival Don Montagano's son – now he blames Don Coladangelo. Your mentor calls on your loyalty to thwart an attack on him by the Montaganos. It's now up to you to keep this little conflict from erupting into a full-scale street war.
Trigger Man puts you in the shoes of the underworld’s toughest mob enforcer. You’ll have to work fast; all you have are your wits, muscle and brute force.
Trigger Man features:

Eight mobster missions: In the name of the Coladangelo Family, engage in the destruction of rival gang operations, intimidation or assassination of witnesses and rival mob leaders, and wounding a “soldier” here and there as a message to his boss.  
Realistic locales: Search through deserted loading docks, duke it out in a fine Italian restaurant or scour a casino for your prey. There are many locations for your enemies to hide.  
Knife-cam: Use a special throwing knife to rub out your enemies silently from a distance. When you throw a knife, a first-person camera attaches to it and allows you to ""steer"" as it flies toward your victim.

The face of war has changed in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter™. Enemy lines blur and there is no longer a clear opponent. New enemies and new threats require a new type of warfare and a new type of soldier. Enter the Ghosts.
In 2013, the U.S. Army will implement the Integrated Warfighter System evolving what we know as the modern soldier. IWS combines advanced weapon systems, satellite communication devices, and enhanced survivability into one fully integrated combat system. The IWS program has been developed to meet these new threats head on. Now, it can be tested on the battlefield.
In this next installment in Ubisoft's award-winning squad-based military shooter series, become the soldier of the future. Equipped with cutting edge weapons and communications systems, you will find yourself immersed in a detailed universe that sets the stage for the urban war of the near future.




Next-generation gaming technology: Advanced Warfighter is built from the ground up for the Xbox 360™, maximizing increased power to deliver phenomenal graphics and a host of innovative features. 
The soldier of the future: Gain access to the future of military technology. Using a fully integrated combat system with cutting-edge weapons and communication systems, gamers will embody the soldier of the future. Based on actual military research, the Ghosts give gamers a realistic view of how war will be fought in the next decade.
Revolutionary feature: Use the revolutionary Cross-Com, a communication device powered by satellite technology. Attached to the soldier's monocle, the Cross-Com provides full situational awareness and command of the battlefield. Command the Ghost squad and remote allied forces and drones, and direct artillery and air strikes. See what the squad sees and receive visual and auditory intelligence from allied forces and unmanned drones. 
Stunning urban environment: One capital, multiple locations. Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter takes place entirely in Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities. A stunning, meticulously detailed universe provides complete immersion in the urban war of the future.
Top-notch multiplayer experience: Just like the previous Ghost Recon titles, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter delivers industry-leading multiplayer and cooperative gameplay for Xbox LIVE®.

The year is 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. With only        six years left until the mysterious crystalline structure Tiberium        renders the earth entirely uninhabitable, the two opposing factions –        Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod – inevitably        find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from        extinguishing mankind. The unthinkable becomes reality and Nod’s        enigmatic leader Kane takes off for GDI headquarters. What is Kane        planning in the heart of his enemies’ base? Command & Conquer 4 draws the epic conclusion to the beloved Tiberium universe, where fans        will learn the fate of Earth, Nod, Tiberium, GDI and most importantly,        Kane’s motivations behind his decade-long plan.
In addition to the two campaigns on the epic battles of GDI and Nod,        which players will get to conquer alone or in a cooperative mode, Command        & Conquer 4 will also feature a new 5v5 objective-based        multiplayer mode, promoting teamwork and cooperation and delivering a        social real-time-strategy experience never seen before in a Command &        Conquer game.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

High-speed races on powerful bikes alternate with motocross on more nimble machines for a white-knuckle ride that remains playable despite the need for technical prowess, with rules of fair-play often put to one side. Moto Racer 4, which is still developed by Microïds and Artefacts Studio, under the supervision of its original designer, Paul Cuisset, will include no less than 15 single and multiplayer game modes. In addition to regular fixtures such as the Time Trial, Single Race and Championship, here are a few examples of what to expect:
- KING OF THE HILL: Each rider starts with the same time on the clock. While time runs down for the leader, the other racers get extra turbo. The first player to get their counter down to zero wins the race.
- LAST MAN STANDING: The last player to pass each checkpoint is eliminated.
- SURVIVAL: The race starts with very little time on the clock. Players gain time by passing the checkpoints. In single-player mode, the aim is to survive for a specific length of time. In multi-player mode, the winner is the last player with time left on their clock.
- CATCH-UP: The player's opponents begin the race with a headstart and the player must be in first place at a specific time.
- WOLF PACK: The player begins the race with a headstart and must maintain it for a certain length of time without being overtaken.
- GHOST BIKE: The player starts the race in last place and is not allowed to deviate from the road or collide with others. S/he must finish in a specified minimum place.
- GOLDEN HELMET: Competitors must earn the one golden helmet up for grabs during therace. To do this, they must be first past the initial checkpoint. If the player wearing the golden helmet is knocked by another player, s/he surrenders it to that player. If a player falls off their bike, s/he loses the helmet and it is automatically sent to the next checkpoint.

Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments.









Streamlined combat

Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.By focusing on aggressive mechanics, new players will be able to easily nail impressive combos while not feeling overwhelmed by friends who’ve had a bit more practice. Ideal for beginners as well as pro gamers looking to dedicate the time to participate in the many tournaments we have planned throughout the year.







Action is kept fast and fluid

Advanced techniques like air dodging, wavedashes, directional influence, teching, ledge grabs or Rage Bursts.









Vastly different combat styles

Each character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.







Rage Meter

The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.









Single Player Modes

AI opponents are available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all:

Train with Advanced Tutorials
Practice advanced combo setups with custom settings and helpful visual aids
Climb the challenging Arcade Towers.








Multiplayer Game Modes

Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles:

All on the same device
Each with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby (Nintendo Switch only)
Go online to challenge players worldwide or create custom lobbies just for your friends, with custom game rules

In his battle against conspiracy and rebellion, he recruits five specialists in assassination, sabotage and espionage.
The team must fight against the mysterious Kage-sama, who plans to overthrow the Shogun. They infiltrate castles, gather information through espionage, fight rebellions and ruthlessly eliminate Kage-sama’s allies. The group is comprised of very different personalities; working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will face some kind of personal drama.
 
Command a team of ninjas in a game where stealth is everything and being spotted by the enemy means almost certain death.
Skillfully hide from and sneak past the enemies fields of view, take their formations apart and hide their bodies to cover your tracks. Quick Save will enable you to execute your plans perfectly. Tactically plan actions for your whole team and execute them all at once. Make use of the vertical gameplay and jump from roof to roof to silently kill your foes from above.
Play it your way: Dozens of solutions to take enemy setups apart, you can creatively use all of your resources – characters, skills and environment – to outsmart, sneak past, kill or knock out enemies
Small team vs. large enemy force: Control a team of five specialists, including a ninja, a samurai and a geisha, and take on an overwhelming opposition.
Careful planning, fast execution: Observe the enemy and plan your approach, because when it’s time to act, you must be quick, precise and undetected.

An abandoned farmhouse becomes your new home, and  the fields your new responsibility. Plant crops in the spring and reap  the rewards before winter comes and covers the land in snow. Trade crops  for animals, raise and breed them, and use their unique abilities to  hunt wild animals and defend your farm.
In Shepherd's Crossing for the PSP it’s up to you to  run your own farm and make it thrive.  The game is all about the  sheep.  In fact, the main source of income is based on high-quality wool  products.  Turn your small, empty farm into a successful sheep colony  in order to complete the game’s main story, but the game doesn’t end  there.  After the story you can continue to build, customize and grow  your farm, so the fun never stops.
Though you begin with just a small plot of land, a sickle, and some  grass and pasture to tend to, you can grow this grass and trade it in  the village for new items for your farm such as crops or animals.   Growing these new crops or raising and breeding the animals will give  you additional items that can be traded for even more new crops or  animals.  It is this growing and trading system that will allow you to  expand your farm and turn it into a thriving business.  The townsfolk  will be there not only to trade with you but also to offer advice and  help.  Throughout the game they will introduce you to new animals, make  you meals from your crops, give you gifts if they like you, and  occasionally even share some know-how or new farming techniques
 
Key Features:

 Plant seeds, and grow crops to build a thriving farm.
Raise a wide variety of animals, including 12 breeds of dog.
Trade your way up a complex chain of products to become a master farmer.
Hunt wild animals to defend your farm and collect resources.
Unlock special items, and earn trophies for exceptional skill.

Take the wheel of a flying car and don't be late for a second term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry™ in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets™! Based on J.K. Rowling's second book in the worldwide best-selling series, players face a magical multitude of new challenges and mysteries as the famous ""Boy Who Lived"" for the PlayStation® 2 computer entertainment system, Nintendo GameCube™, Xbox® video game system form Microsoft, PC, Game Boy™ Advance, PlayStation® and Game Boy® Color.   Ignoring Dobby™ the house-elf's grave warning that disaster will strike if he returns to Hogwarts, Harry embarks on his second year to find Dobby's predictions coming true! Harry soon finds himself entangled in a dark plot against his ""Mudblood"" classmates, as students keep turning up petrified! Could Draco Malfoy™ be to blame, or is something even more malevolent at work? With the help of returning friends Hermione, Ron, Hagrid™ and Hedwig™, players attend new classes to learn second-year spells that will aid them in a quest to uncover the true identity of the ""Heir of Slytherin"".  On the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, and PC, players enter fantastical free-roaming 3D environments from Harry's world.

Conversing with unique characters like Moaning Myrtle™, shopping in Diagon Alley™, and exploring the convoluted corridors of Hogwarts, players make crucial and independent decisions within Harry's world.   Additionally, Harry can, of course, cast spells against foes – but these spells must be perfectly executed, or they could be miscast with humorous or critical consequences! Mini-games within levels can be revisited, so players can help Mrs. Weasley with ""de-gnoming"" her garden, challenge other students in Professor Lockhart's Dueling Club, or complete other mini-games again and again.   Harry returns to the PlayStation, to explore new interactive environments in an action/adventure quest to win the House Cup.

Featuring Quidditch™ matches, magical duels and other wizard-world mini-games, the Game Boy Color title allows multi-player magical encounters with the denizens of Hogwarts, and more collecting of Famous Witches and Wizard Cards.

Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

This is the game that Rail enthusiasts have been waiting for! Rail Simulator provides the most realistic simulation of trains possible on a PC. Plus we provide you, the player, with powerful tools to create your own railway world.
 The ability to add additional material to the simulation has been central in the design of the simulation. Rail Simulator allows easy inclusion of add-on material covering new routes, rolling stock and additional missions. We are currently working with third party developers and expect to have additional add-ons for the game available shortly after its release.
 
Of great importance to the more enthusiastic railway fan is the ability to create their own additional routes, so included with Rail Simulator is an editor that allows the creation of new environments. These tools have been developed with simplicity in mind, so as to encourage the development and exchange of user-generated content, which can be shared and used by other railway enthusiasts.

God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Tchoup can pick items and keep them in his pockets, and he’s a detective. His friend Stucco is not as good at the deductive reasoning (to be honest, he’s not good at all!) – but he is strong enough to do lifting and climbing. The third goblin, Perlius, is the one with the magic powers and a dark sense of humor.The games mix elements of adventure and puzzle gaming. In essence, the player must find the solution to each level, in order to progress to the next. An original aspect of the series is that the player usually controls multiple goblins as player characters, each of whom has a unique set of abilities (the number of letter i’s in the word ""Goblin"" of the title indicates the number of characters that the player may control). The player may only control one character at a time but, depending on the specific scene, may switch characters at will. "
