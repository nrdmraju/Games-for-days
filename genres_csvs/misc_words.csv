Wii Play,"wii play consists of nine games:

table tennis- move the wii remote left or right to hit the ball back and forth.
laser hockey- it is, essentially, air hockey played with a wii remote.
fishing- simple fishing game where you use the wii remote to hook and yank a fish from a pond.
find mii- players must pick out certain mii from a crowd of miis in a limited amount of time.
pose mii- use the wii remote pointer to move a mii into falling bubbles, and use the a button to change its pose.
shooting range- use the wii remote to shoot targets on the screen.
billiards- use the wii remote as a pool stick to play a game of nine ball.
charge!- use the wii remote as a steering wheel to guide your cow through a course.
tanks!- use the nunchuck attachmen or the wii remote d pad to move a tank on screen, while using the pointer to shoot at enemies. 

these can all be played by 1 or 2 players.
the biggest draw with wii play is the fact that it is bundled with an extra wii remote. it is perfect for people who are looking to pick up an extra controller.
the games are very simplistic. the ones that require the most strategy are tanks! and laser hockey. shooting range is remeniscent of duck hunt, and games like find mii and pose mii make use of a multitude of mii characters, including ones of your own creation.
overall, the game is most enjoyable when played with a friend

Wii Party,"
the whole family stars in its own electronic board game
most video games require players to focus their attention on a screen.        now nintendo brings the action into the living room with wii party, a        game that changes the way people interact with other players. featuring        13 different party game modes and 70+ minigames, wii party can be        enjoyed by everyone in the family, regardless of age.
features:

 some of the 13 different party game modes take the fun out of the tv          and into the living room. players have to interact with one another in          the real world to get the results they want in the game. some house          party games include:
players place four wii remote controllers on a table. each one emits          a different animal noise. players win the round by being the first to          grab the controller that is making the sound of the animal shown on          the tv. 
 players use wii remote controllers to play hide and go seek. one          player asks the other players to leave the room and then hides all of          the controllers around the living room. when the other players return,          they have to find them. 
 wii party features mii characters in minigames in which up to four          people can play together. each player uses only the wii remote          controller. some of the party game modes are cooperative, such as          “balance boat.” others are competitive, such as “board game island.” 
 in board game island mode, players help their mii characters compete          in more than 70 different minigames:
 mii characters ride a rollercoaster while players try to shoot down          floating balloons containing gifts 
 players use their wii remote controllers to help mii characters          navigate a virtual game of tag. 

*for multiplayer modes, additional wii remote controllers are        required and are sold separately.

Mario Party DS,"everything you love about mario party...in the palm of your hand! the party boards and minigames are crazier than ever in a new title that shrinks down the whole mario crew for whimsical party play.

with 70+ minigames and five themed game boards, mario party ds packs all the goods for portable play. and it’s brought to life with fun surprises players can see only on nintendo ds, such as touch control, microphone control and dual-screen challenges.
users can play as one of eight characters: mario, luigi, yoshi, peach, daisy, toad, wario and waluigi. they’re all ready to foil bowser’s latest scheme. he seeks five powerful crystals and shrinks down the crew so they can’t stop him. but each of the tiny heroes wants to be the one and only superstar that brings down bowser.
mario party ds makes the series’ multiplayer action portable at last, from playing with friends on the game boards to challenging them in favorite minigames. and now players can throw a party anywhere and play wirelessly with friends, since much of the game can be shared to other nintendo ds systems from just one game card.

game storyline: when mario and his friends are shrunk down for mario party ds, harmless locations take on menacing proportions in five game boards, such as wiggler’s garden and toadette’s music room.how to progress through the game: in the mario party series, after everyone takes a turn moving on the game board, the action shifts to a minigame. in mario party ds, the minigames are crazier than ever, because everyday objects are a huge threat to the minimized crew. more than 70 minigames use the nintendo ds touch screen, the microphone and standard buttons in a surprising combination of ways. players will fling massive hamburgers with the stylus, drag huge leaves out of the way in a forest race and literally blow down a gargantuan whomp.

story mode (1 player): in this solo mode, mario and his friends are shrunk down by bowser. as players make their way to bowser’s castle, they must win first place on each game board, then beat the boss minigame for each board.
party mode (1-4 players): compete against human or system-controlled players on a party board in a battle royale, tag battle or duel battle.
minigame mode (1-4 players): enjoy six games that draw upon the pool of 70+ minigames for challenges that don’t take place on the game boards: free play, step it up, battle cup, score scuffle, boss bash and rocket rascals.
puzzle mode (1-2 players): play six puzzle-action games, which include five classics from previous mario party games. this mode also includes the new touch-controlled triangle twisters, which has two play modes. in frenzy mode, players clear the field by twisting triangles so they connect with those of the same color. in focus mode, they twist them to build complex shapes, like turtles and pinwheels.
multiplayer (2-4 players): using one game card, players can wirelessly share party mode and minigame mode (2-4 players), plus puzzle mode (2 players) and the download-only extras mode with nearby friends who have a nintendo ds. extras mode includes games that are designed for two-player gaming: cooperative pen pals and competitive desert duel.
gallery mode: check out 150 prizes, which includes figures, music and cutscenes.

characters: play as eight classic characters, including mario, luigi, wario, waluigi, yoshi, daisy, peach and toad. the tiny characters will encounter many “gigantic” friends and foes from the mario universe, including bowser, toadette, donkey kong and hammer bro.special powers/weapons/moves/features: mario party ds brings back a play dynamic from previous games: putting traps on board spaces. players can obtain hexes, such as the coin swap hex, then stick them on board spaces in the hope that other players stop on them.

Mario Party 8,"the world's enormously popular party video game is getting a lot crazier in mario party 8. whether you're shaking up cola cans or lassoing barrels, you and your friends will be drawn into the action like never before using the wii remote™.

play with motion control: players row their way through a river race, punch a statue to pieces, steer race cars, mopeds and go-karts and handle a balancing pole while walking a tightrope.
play using the wii remote as a pointer: shoot at boos in a haunted house, drag and drop toppings in a cake-decorating competition, select the correct answers in game show challenges.
play using the wii remote's buttons: players jump and pummel their way through a football brawl, and hop and run across a field of spinning platforms
mario party 8 also includes dozens of new minigames, six new party boards and many new game modes. in a series first, players can transform their characters into many forms, such as player-smashing boulders and coin-sucking vampires.
mario party 8 also includes ""extra-large"" minigames like star carnival bowling and table menace. one to four players can play mario party 8, each with a wii remote.

game storyline: in mario party 8, a hyperactive emcee has invited mario, peach and the rest of the crew to his carnival, a perfect setting for the dynamic spectacle of the wii game play. mario party 8 keeps the surprises coming with minigames that draw upon the wii remote's motion, pointing and button control in a variety of ways. players always know how to jump into the action by watching an animated tutorial that shows how to use the wii remote.how to progress through the game: following tradition, mario party 8 takes the social, strategic game play of board games and adds breaks for quick, action-oriented minigames. in the main mode, players travel across six boards in search of stars, landing on spaces that are helpful (example: giving coins) or a hindrance (example: sending bowser in to mess with the player). several variations for these boards tweak the main goals to enhance game play for solo sessions, two-player games and three- to four-player games.in addition, mario party 8 includes four more minigame-infused kinds of special games, such as tic-tac drop, where players earn the right to put the next mark on the board by winning a minigame.characters: mario party games are a celebration of all things mario, so you can play as 14 classic characters, the widest selection yet for the series, including newcomers hammer bro and blooper. you'll also bump into many old friends and foes that span 20+ years of mario games.special powers/weapons/moves/features: beyond using the wii remote's motion and pointer control, this eighth game in the mario party series goes its own way with two changes:

players can transform their character using candy power-ups. examples: when peach eats bowlo candy, she'll turn into a peach-faced ball and bowl over characters to get their coins. when wario eats vampire candy, he'll sprout wings and fly off to suck the coins from all other players.

guitar hero™ iii: legends of rock continues to build on guitar hero’s        successful easy to play, but difficult to master gameplay mechanic to        take the franchise to a whole new level. with master tracks from        legendary bands like sex pistols, guns ‘n’ roses, rolling stones,        metallica, and pearl jam, along with original music composed        specifically for the game by iconic guitarists slash and tom morello,        guitar hero iii: legends of rock sports the greatest soundtrack to ever        find its way into a videogame. vastly improved graphics immerse gamers        into their rock arenas and heighten their visual experience while the        new wireless gibson guitar controllers allow the players to channel        their inner guitar gods. the arcade-inspired battle mode, expanded co-op        career and boss battles add depth and extend gameplay for countless        hours of shred time.
crank it up to 11 and get ready to rock – featuring over        70% master recordings, spanning over 40 years of music across many rock        genres, guitar hero fans have the opportunity to shred to one of the        greatest compilations of music ever. adding to the track list are some        of the most legendary european anthems with a vast array of downloadable        content post-launch. from metallica to muse and rolling stones to rage        against the machine, guitar hero iii: legends of rock offers up a truly        legendary set list.
truly exclusive music – multiple tracks that can only be        found in the game include guitar icons slash and tom morello        contributing original guitar riffs for their boss battles. also, the sex        pistols re-entered the studio for the first time in 30 years to        re-record “anarchy in the u.k.” providing guitar hero iii: legends of        rock an original recording not available anywhere else. additionally,        living colour re-recorded their grammy award winning “cult of        personality” adding a solo that left legendary guitarist vernon reid        grunting.
an authentic look and feel – improving the graphics from        the ground up have created a more intense visual element giving guitar        heroes the sense of performing on their own rock stage. slash, tom        morello and bret michaels spent hours in motion capture suits so that        their movements and styles were translated perfectly to their in-game        characters. venue light shows have been coordinated for each song along        with choreographing the animations for each band member. ultra-detailed        textures in the fictional characters and multiple outfits give the        option of customizing the guitarist to meet everyone’s inner grunge,        punk, metal or anything in between.
rock this way – the arcade-inspired battle mode adds a new        dimension to the guitar hero franchise. the idea isn’t necessarily to        hit the most notes, but rather hit the right ones and learn the nuances        of using the power-up attacks. with guitar battle, star power sequences        are replaced with battle power sequences. hit every note in the battle        power sequence and receive a power-up that can be used to attack the        competition.
you’ve got to beat the best, to be the best – battle mode        lends itself to the boss battles featuring slash and tom morello. after        defeating a boss, unlock them as a playable character and continue to        the encore for the set list, which is a master recording of one of their        most legendary songs. after defeating slash, the next performance is        “welcome to the jungle” and slash stays on stage to play with the gamer.        likewise for tom morello and the hard-hitting “bulls on parade.”
it takes two – taking the co-op experience to the next level is        the new co-op career mode giving guitar heroes the chance to progress        through their career with a friend. since not all songs play well for        both the lead and bass tracks, only the best songs are pulled from the        single player career mode with six co-op career exclusive encore songs.
rockin’ around the world – compete head-to-head in any of        the competitive game modes online to prove who the most legendary guitar        hero really is. or, for those looking for a more friendly experience,        shred to a few tracks on the lead or the bass in co-op online.
dude, where’s my wire? – the wii gibson les paul guitar        controller has a void in the guitar for the wii remote to snap into and        connects to the wii remote via the nunchuk port. by using the wii        remote, the guitar controller utilizes the wireless technology and        accelerometer.
axe innovation – all guitars will have detachable necks for        easier portability as well as storage. adding a new level of        personalization to the les paul guitar controllers are interchangeable        faceplates giving guitar heroes the opportunity to show their style via        their instrument.
adapting the wii remote’s technology, guitar hero iii: legends of rock        uses both the rumble feature and the speaker on the wii remote. the        rumble can be felt shaking the guitar when rocking out with star power.        the speaker comes in handy when playing multiplayer as “clinks” are        heard through the wii remote as opposed to being ported through the tv        speakers.

Flash Focus: Vision Training in Minutes a Day,"put your eye power to work for you. sight training: enjoy exercising and relaxing your eyes for nintendo ds gives your pupils a workout with fun and fast activities. if you have just a few minutes, you can complete a training session in the blink of an eye.  through ten core training exercises, which focus on such everyday functions as hand-eye coordination and eye movement, sight training poses identification and recognition challenges on the ds’s two screens and then asks you to tap the right answers on the touch screen. based on your answers, sight training gives you an eye age – much like the brain age of the brain training series – to determine the ds age of your vision. the software charts your progress as you train toward the ultimate in-game eye age of 20. the activities in sight training succeed in being both simple yet challenging. in box track, a ball is placed in one of three boxes on the touch screen. the challenge is to follow the box with the ball in it as the three are shuffled rapidly on the screen. you then tap the box you think has the ball. the exercise number tap calls on the user to match the number shown on the top screen to its counterpart in a grid of 20 numbers on the touch screen.  sight training also features eight sports training exercises. these activities take the principles applied in the eye power exercises and put them into familiar athletic scenarios. boxing, for example, puts you in the ring with a trainer who’s holding two target mitts. you need to tap the centre of the target before the sparring partner moves it. after training for a certain amount of time, the game will automatically switch to a relaxation mode, in which a soothing voice will guide you through a set of eye relaxation exercises. up to four people can save their eye age records on one ds game card. the software uses five different aspects of your vision: hand-eye coordination, peripheral vision, eye movement, momentary vision and dynamic visual acuity. each training session lasts only 2 to 3 minutes so it is easy to make it part of your daily routine.source - www.nintendo.com  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Personal Trainer: Cooking,"personal trainer: cooking is a training title that brings gourmet cooking from around the globe to your nintendo ds. it features a ds chef, your own private cooking instructor who talks you through 245+ recipes from more than 30 countries worldwide. it's a combination of interactive cookbook and live cooking demonstration that'll have you cooking like a pro, even if you've never lifted a ladle before.
 

you and the chef will collaborate on a wide variety of recipes, with videos of techniques, explanations of ingredients and expert advice. with its innovative interface and the interactivity that only the ds can provide, it's a perfect learning tool for the budding chef. 
as you browse recipes, just tap a box to mark ingredients you need to buy. the ds will automatically store them in your in-game shopping list. later you can take your ds to the store and check off the ingredients as you put them in your cart. 
search for recipes by ingredients, calorie count, cooking time, difficulty and more. 
hands covered in batter? keep your ds clean using voice commands to continue to the next page, repeat a step, go back and more 

.
game description: the first thing to do is select a recipe. with 245+ to choose from, personal trainer: cooking makes it easy to find what you're looking for by helping you browse by country, ingredients, difficulty, cooking time, cooking technique or even calorie count. once you've found something that looks tasty, take a look at the ingredients. out of butter or need to buy some cumin? just tap them with the stylus to automatically add the ingredients to your shopping list. making several dishes tonight? just keep tapping ingredients - your shopping list keeps it all in one place for you. now that you've got your ingredients, it's time to start cooking. the ds chef is there with you, talking you through every step along the way. don't know how to fillet a trout? watch the demonstration video when you get to that step. didn't quite catch the last step? just say ""repeat,"" and the chef will explain it again. you can pause the recipe at any time to consult the cooking a-z guide, and prompts will appear within recipes for specific terms you might need more information about.
becoming a better cook: when you finish each recipe, you put a stamp on the in-game calendar, marking what you've made and when you made it. later, you can search by whether or not you've made a dish before, allowing you to perfect your technique on a particular recipe, or keep expanding your culinary horizons. with an extensive in-game reference of cooking terms, pictures and demonstration videos, you can tailor your cooking experience to your level of skill, then watch that skill grow as you keep cooking.
special input options: the game can be controlled entirely with the stylus, for maximum accessibility. when your hands are full, covered in cookie batter or otherwise unavailable, all of the in-recipe commands can be given by speaking to the ds microphone. the keyword search function uses handwriting recognition, so you can simply write out that you're looking for a ""sweet"" something. finally, that same handwriting recognition is used to make notes on recipes. if you want to remember to reduce the salt, or simply that this recipe was especially tasty, the software takes the same role as the handwritten note in a cookbook.

Mario Party,"mario party is the first of several mario games planned for this year that are being created by developers outside of nintendo. in this case, the developer is hudson, a company best known for the bomberman series, while the others are hal systems, the creator of the kirby line (which is handling the mario fighting game, smash brothers), and hot shots golf maker camelot (which is doing mario golf). each of the games' focus plays to what the developers know best, in this case, hudson's knowledge of good multiplayer game modes gleaned from producing countless incarnations of bomberman, the seminal party-game series. how do they do that? by setting up mario party as a video game take on a traditional board game. one to four players compete against each other (and computer opponents if there are fewer than four humans present) for coins, stars, and bonus points. instead of going the route of monopoly's little dog and top hat assortment, mario party offers a handful of mario characters for use as ""game pieces"" such as mario, yoshi, wario, peach, donkey kong, and luigi. each of the title's boards is based on the series as well (donkey kong has a jungle stage, yoshi an island, and so on), and each differs in prominent ways. once the characters and board are chosen, you vie for the order you'll proceed through the game by stopping a rotating number block, which reappears at the beginning of each turn to decide how many spaces you'll move. plain spaces provide a number of coins, while specially marked spaces will draw you into bonus minigames (explained fully later) or introduce you to friendly or unfriendly nonplayer characters such as toad, shy guy, and boo. the one you least want to bump into is of course bowser, who will either steal coins from you outright or engage you in forced minigames where you don't gain any coins if you win, and you lose coins if you lose. the main goal is to have the largest total number of stars at the end of a game, which can be bought along the way from toad or by paying off a boo to steal one from one of your opponents (this costs more than twice the regular 20-coin amount but is much more fun). the minigames are the mario party features that most take advantage of the title not being set on a flat plate of cardboard. you enter at the end of each round or by landing on marked spaces on the board. the games come in various shapes and sizes and in configurations of every player against the others, two vs. two, or three against one. of the 50 in all, the most noteworthy examples are probably the bobsled run (which is reminiscent of the snow race in super mario 64, but with two characters sharing a sled), face lift (you try to drag around a mushed face a la super mario 64's intro), mario bandstand (a distant cousin of parappa the rapper), lava boardin' (you race down a collapsing platform and jump over obstacles), and cash bash (one player is dressed up as bowser, and the others hit him with hammers and steal his coins). some are skill based, while many require button mashing or joystick twirling. the winner or winners gain coins, while the losers pay out or just leave with what they came into the game with - nothing more, nothing less.playing with a group of friends makes this game shine. there are enough random elements at work that enable huge upsets to happen about once every other round (which continues straight up to the end when bonus stars are given out that can nudge second- or third-place players to the forefront), and going after the lead player or teaming up against the computer is superfun - especially when you're trying to garner stars for the collective total (get enough and... things happen). on the negative side, some of the minigames aren't very fun to play in the multiplayer mode because of control or perspective problems, or because they're just plain boring - but that's to be expected with the sheer number of games. meanwhile, the games that are enjoyable to play in multiplayer are nowhere near as good in the single-player mode. really, it's that multiplayer competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they're just simple little games. the single-player mode seems thrown in the way multiplayer modes seem thrown in most other games. mario party is intended to be played with a group of friends, and for those people who can really take advantage of that, this game is a must-buy. the less-social gamer might want to rent.

SingStar,"from scee london studio, the same team who persuaded you to leap around your living room swatting imaginary ghosts and busting lethal kung fu moves in the direction of your tv with eyetoy, comes singstar, the latest in interactive entertainment designed to get everyone up and playing. one of the most involving and addictive titles to come out for ps2 for some time, singstar has the rather impressive ability to ensnare everyone who sees it in action. unlike the typically mortifying experience of getting up on a small stage in your local pub and being forced to croak out a number from the popular hit parade (circa 1982, usually), singstar is actually a stress-free and hugely entertaining experience that, once sampled, will have even the most shy and retiring of types casting aside their inhibitions. as well as having the canny knack of breaking the ice at even the frostiest of familial get-togethers, singstar is also an involving single-player game that actually encourages you to hone your warbling skills. this may all sound suspiciously familiar, but leave your preconceptions at the door: singstar is actually a highly innovative title that's unlike anything you'll have ever played before.

To the Moon,"dr. eva rosalene and dr. neil watts have rather peculiar jobs:
they give people another chance to live.literally.
there  exists a technology that allows doctors to weave artificial memories,  such that a patient can request attempts to alter their mind, and wake  up with memories of things that didn't actually happen.
however,  since these new memories are permanent, the conflict between them and  the existing authentic memories clash in such a way that it ceases the  person's ability to properly function.
thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to  fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives. . . but didn't.
the  technology requires the doctors to step into the memories of the  patient, which are reconstructed as interactive scenes. the doctors then  gradually traverse backwards through memories of the patient's life  until they reach childhood -- at which point, the wish of the patient in  present time would be transferred over. 
along with the doctors'  influence, the patient (as a child) could then lead an entire different  life inside their head, working toward and fulfilling their dying wish  themselves.
and if all goes well, they would wake up,  having lived the dream life they never had, and embrace a brief moment  of blissful fulfillment.
shortly after, they'd draw their last breath.
this  particular story follows dr. rosalene and dr. watts' attempt to fulfill  the dream of the dying elderly man, johnny. in their mission to do so,  they traverse backwards through the man’s memories, unfolding his  curious life story before their eyes.
with each step back in time,  a new fragment of johnny's past is revealed. and as the two doctors  piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to  find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it  is. 
and johnny's last wish is, of course. . . to go to the moon.

WarioWare D.I.Y.,"through the years, nintendo has created hundreds of microgames for  the warioware™        series. now we want to see what you've got. the warioware:  d.i.y. game lets players create the same kind of microgames that are the        hallmark of the warioware series. players design every  aspect of        their creations, including graphics, animation, music and rules.
features:

 do it yourself! take on the role of game designer and create  your own          microgames by crafting everything from artwork, animations,  music and          action instructions. 
 warioware: d.i.y. comes with more than 90 pre-made games  to          play, but players who have access to a broadband internet  connection          can wirelessly download a virtually endless supply of  user-generated          games, or upload their own creations to share with the world. 
 when creating games, players can utilize a library of pre-made          graphics and sound samples, borrow elements from other  microgames on          their system, or start from scratch. 
 sharing new content is the real key to warioware: d.i.y.,  and          there are a number of ways for players to participate: 
 using a local wireless connection, friends can swap micro-games,           comics and music they have created. 
 after the game launches, nintendo will regularly make new  micro-games          available for download to players who have access to a broadband           internet connection. 
 from time to time, nintendo will challenge warioware: d.i.y. players to create games based on a specific theme. nintendo will  make          the best submissions available for download to players with a  wireless          broadband internet connection. 
 players can upload items to their storage crate in the warehouse           (wireless broadband internet access required). these products  can then          be downloaded by any of the friends with whom they have  exchanged          friend codes. 
 if you want to take a break from creating and playing games, why  not          try your hand at a comic strip? warioware: d.i.y. includes  all          the tools artists need to compose their own four-panel comic  strips. 
 players who have a wii™ console can add another dimension to  their          game. by downloading the warioware: d.i.y. showcase game  from          nintendo's wiiware™ service, players get access to 72 more          micro-games, and can experience the games they created with  their          nintendo ds™ system on their tv. each of the elements in these  new          games then becomes a part of the player's toolbox. the wiiware  game          also includes an unlockable multiplayer mode that lets up to  four          people play micro-games competitively (additional accessories  required          and are sold separately).

Soul Sacrifice,"what are you prepared to sacrifice?
as you awaken, held captive in a nightmare prison of bones and with no memory of who you are and how you came to be there, all hope seems lost. held prisoner by the evil sorcerer magusar, you are little more than livestock – a human offering, kept alive only to be sacrificed to the dark arts that your captor practises. just as all chances of escape seem to have been crushed – along with your fellow prisoners at the hands of magusar – a potential saviour appears...
librom, an enchanted talking book, begins calling to you from beneath a gruesome pile of bones, beckoning you closer to open his pages and begin reading the journal contained within. as you read, you are transported from your prison into a shadowy realm where you meet a young – and strangely familiar – sorcerer. guided by librom, you begin to relive the dark tale of the young mage’s training titled “the sorcerer’s ordeal” and learn the secrets of forgotten magic just as he did. to gain new spells and abilities, you must face a series of gruesome creatures that will put your skills to the test – from grotesque goblins to huge, terrifying mythical creatures like the harpy, cerberus and the brutal minotaur.
but with great power comes great sacrifice. to master the magic in librom’s pages and become powerful enough to face magusar and win your freedom, you must decide what you’re willing to sacrifice; your allies, your body… or your humanity.

program your own version of famous songs and share them with other   players. or jam to a collection of popular songs from a constantly   expanding song list. if you're after a unique gameplay experience then   be sure to turn up the volume and jam with the band!
following on from a range of acclaimed music games like rhythm   paradise and wii music, jam with the band allows you to get creative and   program your own tracks in the game’s song editor using up to eight   different parts on each track from a collection of more than 50   instruments, or create melodies by simply humming into the nintendo ds   in-built microphone.
the game is designed to appeal to a wide range of music lovers. it   comes with 50 pre-installed songs, and approximately 50 more will be   downloadable via nintendo wi-fi connection. you will also be able to   upload your own ""versions"" of the tracks, which can be downloaded by   other users. via a dedicated website, you can see the newest and most   popular tracks available and even rate the tracks.
enjoy using the stylus on the touch screen of your nintendo ds to   strum a guitar, or let the karaoke mode bring fun to your vocal chords   utilising the in-built nintendo ds microphone.  the game will even   analyse your singing style to suggest the best music genre to sing in.
there is a captivating difficulty mode which takes you from utilising   one or four buttons whilst jamming to eight and ten, or play with the   stylus and touch screen in your music-making challenges. and why keep  it  to yourself? with one copy of the game up to eight people can each  take  a part and jam together!
you can also connect your nintendo ds or nintendo dsi to your wii   console and send the sounds from your nintendo ds to the speakers of   your tv sound system.  a free jam with the band live channel for wii can   be downloaded, meaning you and up to seven friends can enjoy the whole   sound of the band from one set of speakers! and the fun keeps coming  as  you can utilise the nintendo wi-fi connection service, enabling you  free  access to approximately 50 downloadable songs and some content  from  other users and multiplayer sessions.  
if you ever fancied your own easy-to-operate, creative and fun pocket   music studio, get with the beat and grab your copy of jam with the   band!
the game comes with a total of 50 songs preinstalled which include   renowned classical songs as well as popular titles such as:

You're in the Movies,"
you're in the movies brings the cool factor to kitsch as you live out your dreams of becoming a scream queen, zombie, or kung fu fighter. premiering exclusively on xbox 360® this holiday season, it's the first and only game of its kind to transport players into a magical world of cinema mixed with the hilarious world of improvisation. using the xbox live vision camera, players' actions are captured and placed into short, riotous films that highlight the unique and often dubious acting talents of friends and family. performances never end up on the cutting room floor and are never the same. with you're in the movies, you're about to be a star—if only straight to dvd. get ready for your close-up.




starring in your very own b-movie: you're in the movies gives players, who can be anything from an action hero to a silent film star, a choice of fun and kitschy scripts in different genres. b-list actors often can't be picky, but now you can feel free to pick a genre, pick a script, and get to work becoming the star you were always meant to be.
casting call: up to four people at a time can bask in the spotlight and play starring roles. but rest assured, even your greatest fans will have fun watching from the sidelines! a top-notch director guides actors through their roles with simple instructions and immediate feedback; in fact, the director even rates actors on their physical performance in mini-games. this exciting scoring system will also keep all you a-listers from getting too lazy.
take the director's chair: jump into director mode and cut a trailer for the movie you just made. getting the distribution deal is great, but unless you have a great trailer, no one will see your movie. lock yourself in the edit room and get to work.
the miracle of technology: the xbox live vision camera captures player movements using a green screen type of technology. you're in the movies allows players' best and most hilarious performances to be documented, saved, shared, and relived.

• players can choose to play as a variety of mushroom kingdom characters, as dragon quest characters or even as their own mii™ characters.
• more than 15 different game boards are available, providing endless replay value.

Boogie,"strut your stuff in the funkiest rhythm game ever to take the dance floor. boogie on ds invites you to get your groove on to some of the hottest hits in disco history as you turn your self-created boog into a superstar.
the aim of the game is to keep your boog’s feet moving to the beat by simply drawing lines with your stylus on the touch screen. as long as you follow the on-screen instructions and keep the rhythm, the music will keep playing. funky dancing will also cause your top screen to become increasingly populated with party freak creatures keen to join your personal party! mess up, however, and the party freaks will clear off – leaving you to face the music on you own. when they’ve all gone, your dancing days are over.
before you take the floor, you’ll have to select from one of five unique boogs then customize their look by choosing from more than 500 items of clothing. you can even design your own patterns for them to wear by just drawing on the touch screen! in career mode the object of the game is to dance your way through five different storylines, progressing up the rankings and unlocking new songs as you go. during dance sessions you’ll be thrown into fun mini-games that will boost your overall score if you can stay on your toes and complete them successfully.
if you really want to prove you are worthy of a place in the limelight, why not challenge your mates to a dance-off in multiplayer mode? up to four people can compete against each other if they all have their own copy of boogie, while single-card play means that even if your friend doesn’t own the game you can still connect wirelessly and give them a lesson in how to get their groove on!
and just in case you still don’t feel like dancing, boogie comes complete with a 3d mode and set of 3d glasses that really bring the action to life before your eyes! so what are you waiting for – the floor is yours!

groove to 20 hit songs from down the decades, including famous floor-fillers from disco, funk, pop and rock.   
customize your boog by choosing from more than 500 items of clothing and by designing your own unique patterns on the touch screen. 
challenge your friends in multiplayer mode and prove you are the greatest dancer!

queen cumulus explains that a steady stream of raingear is being thrown onto cloud nine. the raingear has formed a pile so tall that it is starting to topple over—causing raingear to fall down onto wordville. the queen thinks the raingear is coming from a funny island below cloud nine. so reader rabbit and sam the lion zoom to the island in the dreamship to check it out.
reader rabbit and sam the lion discover that the island is full of strange trees that grow raingear. the island is called raingear island, and it’s the home of irvin the inventor. irvin hates rain, so he invented a machine that throws raingear at the clouds to make them go away. but when irvin hears how much trouble the raingear is causing, he agrees to turn off his machine.
there’s just one problem. to turn off his machine, irvin needs three things—a big, round, purple hoop; a bag of extra-stretchy, jumbo rubber bands; and an extra-soft, double-stuffed feather pillow. but he doesn’t have any of the three.
can you help reader rabbit and sam the lion explore cloud nine and raingear island in search of the things that irvin needs? if you find the three items and bring them back to irvin, he will turn off his machine and stop the avalanche of raingear. but don’t delay—the pile of raingear is getting bigger by the minute. if you wait too long, it might topple over and bury wordville!

Flipnic: Ultimate Pinball,"not since the days of amiga's fiendishly addictive 'pinball dreams' has a ball-bearing-based title captured the imaginations of this dedicated team of fin-flippers here at playstation.com quite so completely. the arrival of this unmistakably japanese offering was greeted with unprecedented levels of excitement in the office when the quote on the front of the box was read aloud by staff writer and self-proclaimed pinball sim pro dan maher: ""flipnic is an enjoyable simple-action amazing pinball game for you"". and ubisoft's delightfully surreal game is just that, a wonderfully entertaining slice of ball-flipping action that anyone can enjoy.
the first thing you'll notice when you get your mitts on flipnic is just how huge the 'tables' are. based on five different themes, including jungle, techno and metal, these unique worlds contain stunning landscapes, complete with their own individual wildlife, flora and fauna. the first set of tables has a lush tropical look, with butterflies floating over the game as you frantically bash buttons in an attempt to achieve flipnic's surreal objectives. the challenges include saving pink flamingos from the jaws of hungry crocodiles, destroying ufos, and feeding hungry monkeys by knocking bananas into their waiting paws. and when you're not putting your mean pinballing skills to the test in single-player mode, you can also throw down the gauntlet to friends in multiplayer modes, with pinball soccer and pinball basketball available for two-player action. possibly the most surreal addition to the genre, flipnic sports beautifully vibrant graphics, intuitive controls, and some of the best ball physics you'll ever encounter in a pinball sim ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Virtual Chess 64,"titus has introduced the first chess simulation for the n64, virtual chess. even with most of the options available to pc chess players, 14 skill levels to choose from, and animated fight scenes for the kiddies, the 3d view's lack of visual clarity makes for a frustrating game.virtual chess offers most of the options computerized chess should. for the novice, there's a simple but thorough tutorial. broken up into slim chapters, it's easy to use, whether you're just verifying the rules for taking pawns ""en passant,"" or trying queenside castling for the first time. a save-game feature allows you to see just how stupid a move is before committing to it permanently. unfortunately, there's no option to just retake the last move, so if you're hesitant, save early and save often. if you're still feeling squeamish, there's an onscreen cpu next-move suggestion button available at all times. play in virtual chess is plain hard to see. the pieces are difficult to tell apart from any angle, so you've got to be extra careful to avoid stupid mistakes (or be surprised when the enemy ""king"" easily avoids check by sliding across the entire board). to this end, plan on spending a lot of time rotating the board, which turns a full 360 degrees horizontally or vertically. if you were some kind of crazy nut, you could even attempt to play looking at the felt on the bottom of the board. unfortunately, the board only spins on either axis in one direction, so if you miss your spot, you have to go all the way around again. thankfully, a 2d version is also included, but that removes the whole point of the game: the fight animations.the game would be better off without them anyway. had they occurred on the regular playing screen, that would have been one thing. such is not the case. every time a piece is captured, all the pieces shoot into the air, the screen goes all crazy, and... the board appears again, with a cutscene featuring stylized representations of the capturing piece and its victim squared off to fight. the black knight is a battering ram, the white a unicorn. the black bishop is some sort of mosquito creature, the white a wizard. the black queen is overweight. yawn. the animations are jerky and slow and lose their appeal after the third time or so. thankfully, they may be turned off.ever since r2d2 and chewbacca first played their first near-deadly game of holographic chess (""let the wookie win""), it's seemed like a good idea to offer a chess simulation that comes equipped with 3d fighting sequences for the captures - and this did prove somewhat successful with empire interactive's combat chess for the pc. unless the fighting actually occurs fully rendered using the same engine as the rest of the game, rather than as an annoyingly distracting cutscene, the novelty will always fade fast. masters and novices alike will probably quickly strip virtual chess down to its clearer, more practical 2d mode after a minimum of laughs are achieved from the fights. even in this mode, the game provides a great tool for fans of the ""real thing"" of any skill level.

Major Minor's Majestic March,"
marchtown has always been a town in which drum majors are adored.  one young boy, major minor, wanted more then anything to become the world's greatest drum major and he would stop at nothing to reach his goal. but something was missing.... he needed band members and instruments to start a marching band.  once he inherited the magic baton from his great grandmother he was ready to begin recruiting members for his band. can major minor fulfill his potential and share the joy of marching with the world?

major minor's majestic march marks the return of the creative team behind the renowned parappa the rapper franchise--legendary game designer and multimedia musician masaya matsuura and famed new york artist rodney alan greenblat.
your wii remote is major minor's ""special"" bandleader baton, used to keep tempo, recruit new band members and pick-up valuable items. if your rhythm is unstable confusion will result; band members will drop out and you could ultimately fail the stage.
march in 7 different whimsical locations. use your best efforts to create the most impressive parade ever while nimbly avoiding obstacles.
recruit up to 30 original characters for your band by using the wii remote to attract them to the parade. each player moves at different speeds so it's important to maintain the best rhythm for the overall procession to ensure the highest score for each stage.
add 20+ different instruments to your procession, from brass to woodwinds to percussion. 
as the makeup of the band changes, so does the performance; it all depends on which members you select! try different combinations each time you play.
use your whistle to manage the procession when obstacles appear in your path. train tracks, suspension bridges, a road race, even political rallies can affect a smooth performance that might disperse your band should panic and confusion result.
numerous modes of play include:
single player--progresses the overall game storyline as you play.
cooperative multiplayer mode--play together with a friend to build and maintain the band! 
contest multiplayer mode--compete to see who can amass the largest procession
march and keep tempo to more than 20 well-known marching band tunes from around the world, composed into original medleys for each unique stage.
dazzle the crowd with your incredible baton-twirling displays during drill mode.
unlock new characters, difficulty levels, multiplayer and so much more!

Check vs. Mate,"developed by topware interactive and gaijin entertainment, battle vs chess aims to bring the classic tabletop game into the modern age, without removing the essential qualities that have made it popular for centuries. familiar chess pieces are brought to life as richly detailed 3d models, with players seeing the spectacular results of their actions in their quest for domination of the board.

the traditional white and black armies have evolved into an army of light with their brave knights in shining armor, pitted against the wicked dark army of demons and beastly golems. each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war. if a square is occupied by an enemy unit, they enter into a brutal clash that sees the foe removed from the board in bloody combat.

another evolutionary element battle vs. chess brings to the arena is the addition of the optional action mode. if selected, instead of entering a scripted animation when attacking, players challenge their opponent in a beat-'em-up style encounter. using a variety of weapons, fighting techniques and combos, players must best their opponent in a fast-paced flurry of blows and special moves –adding a whole new meaning to the phrase checkmate.

Check vs. Mate,"developed by topware interactive and gaijin entertainment, battle vs chess aims to bring the classic tabletop game into the modern age, without removing the essential qualities that have made it popular for centuries. familiar chess pieces are brought to life as richly detailed 3d models, with players seeing the spectacular results of their actions in their quest for domination of the board.

the traditional white and black armies have evolved into an army of light with their brave knights in shining armor, pitted against the wicked dark army of demons and beastly golems. each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war. if a square is occupied by an enemy unit, they enter into a brutal clash that sees the foe removed from the board in bloody combat.

another evolutionary element battle vs. chess brings to the arena is the addition of the optional action mode. if selected, instead of entering a scripted animation when attacking, players challenge their opponent in a beat-'em-up style encounter. using a variety of weapons, fighting techniques and combos, players must best their opponent in a fast-paced flurry of blows and special moves –adding a whole new meaning to the phrase checkmate.

before you do anything else, download the game and play the tutorial. it’s fun, it’s free, and it’ll teach you the foundations of heroes of the storm better than any webpage ever could. but once you’re done, come back and learn about all the things the tutorial doesn’t cover.
things you should know after playing the tutorial

movement: getting your hero from a to b should be second nature.
abilities: slinging spells and using skills, easy as pie.
combat: health bars, attacking enemies, healing, and when to tuck tail and run.
death: it’s just a flesh wound!
minions: enthusiastic, single-minded, team-oriented. also, great cannon fodder.
forts: hurt like hell; make sure you have some minions with you.
leveling: gather xp, level up, become stronger.
mercenaries: defeat them at their camp to gain their service.
cores: you lose your core, you lose the game.
hearthstone: press “b” to teleport back to your base. (cards? what cards?)
mount up: press “z” to summon your mount and move faster.

those are the basics of heroes of the storm. enough to play and have fun, but a far cry from complete mastery of the game. what’s that? you’d like to master the storm? well, we can certainly assist you with that. like we said: we’re here to help

Chegger's Party Quiz,"cheggers, chegwin, keith – call him what you will, there is no denying he’s one of britain’s best loved tv personalities…and he’ll be ‘round your house this christmas with cheggers’ party quiz!
keith chegwin rose to fame back in the mid 1970s, when at the tender age of 17, he secured a role as a presenter on multicoloured swap shop, which ran from 1976 to 1982, making a household name of the merseyside lad we’ve all come to know and love.
with over 7,000 tv shows as a presenter under his belt – most famously, cheggers plays pop - and a myriad guest appearances in the nation’s most popular television programmes, keith chegwin has also fronted his own radio shows, written regular newspaper columns and made several records! the fact that there are very few britons that have never heard of him is testament not only to his popularity, which is due in no small part to his infectious charm, but also to the fact that he remains one of the uk’s hardest working stars.
spanning more than three decades, cheggers’ career has seen more than a few ups and downs but he has always bounced back with renewed vim and maintained his position in the very hearts of the uk’s tv viewing public. now he adds another feather in his cap as the presenter of oxygen games’ new quiz title; cheggers’ party quiz, enthusing;
“this is such a fantastic project - i'm so excited by it! i have been very impressed by oxygen games, because of their enthusiasm for this project and i hope that everyone who plays the game thinks it is great fun.”
