Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars,"
the war spills over onto a new patch: the nintendo ds. the long-running grand theft auto franchise debuts on the ds with grand theft auto: chinatown wars.
a new entry into the grand theft auto series and a nintendo ds exclusive, grand theft auto: chinatown wars was built from the ground up for nintendo ds. it’s the story of huang lee, a spoilt, wealthy member of the chinese triad crime syndicate. huang arrives in liberty city after the untimely assassination of his father in hong kong to deliver the ‘yu jian’, a family heirloom, to his power-crazy uncle, wu ‘kenny’ lee. the ‘yu jian’ is a sword that’s been a false symbol of honour, with its history and value draped in lies.
but once huang arrives, he’s ambushed by a car full of gunmen - shot, robbed and left for dead, dumped into the humboldt river. he barely survives, but the ‘yu jian’ is stolen. huang must retrieve the sword for his uncle and take down those who wanted him to sleep with the fishes.
this is a full-fledged grand theft auto experience. as huang, you’ll explore a massive, modern iteration of liberty city. the world of chinatown wars is among the biggest, richest and most detailed gaming environments on nintendo ds. the 3d city is shown from an overhead, angled perspective using a camera that rotates 360 degrees. as they move through the city. the player can see each and every side of all the cars and buildings, giving the environment more of an isometric feel.
in liberty city, you’ll find a large assortment of vehicles such as cars, trucks, vans, buses, boats and motorcycles. when you drive some of the vehicles, you can perform special side-missions, such as taxi missions, fire-fighter missions, paramedic missions, vigilante missions, and food delivery missions.
to learn about the newest missions and more, huang has a handy pda, the main hub of communication and access to game menus. on his pda, huang receives emails and messages from characters as well as special offers from online retailers like ammunation that can deliver the finest custom-ordered guns and ammunition straight to his home. the pda can also serve as a music player, a contacts database and a resource for all current trade information surrounding the in-game economy.
the pda is also equipped with a full-featured gps map. seen on the bottom screen of the ds when you’re driving or on foot, the gps map details key points of interest and mission objectives. players can tap any intersection to set a course for the shortest legal route to any destination - which will change dynamically should the player veer off course. other key points of interest, once you discover them, will also be added to the map, such as pay n sprays, gas stations, safehouses, odd jobs, random encounters, rampages, street races, unique stunt jumps and more.
the police are friends to most citizens. unfortunately for huang, he’s unique. however, your demolition skills can get huang out of hot water. the chinatown wars police-evasion system delivers a fun and frantic arcade-like action experience because instead of evading different levels of police radar on the map, players are now smashing, crashing and ramming cruisers at full speed to disable them. the more cars the player disables, the lower huang’s wanted level falls. the objective, however, isn’t to completely destroy the police vehicles because if the player harms the policemen inside, the wanted level will only increase as a result.
what would a nintendo ds game be without cool touch screen controls? grand theft auto: chinatown wars is no different. you’ll use the touch screen for such activities as bursting out of submerged vehicles, hotwiring cars, preparing molotov cocktails at the gas station, digging through trash bins for hidden weapons and tattooing.
grand theft auto: chinatown wars is not for the kids, as the subject matter is for mature audiences. but for those old enough to get their hands on the game, this is a ds title that raises the bar in terms of both style and substance.

grand theft auto: chinatown wars also utilises nintendo wi-fi connection. players can upload game stats, send messages to friends and exchange items. further details about the game’s wi-fi capabilities and multiplayer modes will be announced soon.
experience changing weather effects and a 24-hour day/night cycle.
pedestrians feature advanced a.i. that allows them to head out of the doors of their homes, about town in their cars and back home again. some may stop to talk to each other, get into arguments, walk in and out of shops, use food stands and more.

this is no easy task, as the evil magician has created three dragons to hinder you in your quest for the golden chalice.  there is a yorgle, the yellow dragon, who is just plain mean; there is grundle, the green dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is rhindle, the red dragon, who is the most ferocious of all.  rindle is also the fastest dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.
there are three castles in the kingdom: the white castle, the black castle, and the golden castle.  each castle has a gate of the entrance.  the gate can be opened with the corresponding colored key.  inside each castle are rooms (or dungeons), depending at which skill level you are playing).
the castles are seperated by rooms, pathways and labyrinths.  common to all the skill levels is the blue labyrinth through which you must find your way to the black castle.  skill levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated kingdom.

Metroid: Zero Mission,"
she's battled baddies on nearly every nintendo system, cleaned house in  the super smash bros.  series, and recently blasted off for heroic  adventures on the gamecube (metroid prime) and the game boy advance  (metroid fusion).  now, samus aran returns to her roots and relives the  story that started it all--revealing for the first time full details of  her meeting with the metroids.  the plotline will be familiar to  longtime fans of the metroid series, but the challenges are new, the  power-ups are plentiful (taken from several games in the series), and  the graphics and sound are supercharged.  plus, if you thought that the  original metroid had a surprise ending, wait until you get past the  mother brain in metroid: zero mission.  a new twist provides a deeper  adventure than ever before.
sent to zebes to investigate rumors of a deadly alien species, samus  meets her match in the form of the mysterious metroids--energy-sapping  creatures that emerge from an oversized cerebrum beneath the planet's  surface.  samus isn't the only traveler searching for the metroids.  a  band of space pirates has touched down to extract the curious creatures  and use them as weapons.  samus must thwart the pirates, but they are  wily and will prove to be more trouble than samus expects.
in the long-standing metroid tradition, zero mission is a scavenger hunt  for dozens of items--missiles, energy tanks, and tools--that give you  the ability to explore wider and deeper.  every time you uncover a  device, you'll remember former dead ends that you can finally overcome.   the endless chain of breakthroughs and discoveries causes the world to  continue to grow and form.
the metroids are only one of the many menacing species that lurk below  the surface.  the zebesian underground overflows with creatures that aim  to keep you from invading their turf.  metroid classics kraid and  ridley hold fort in dark corners, towering over the comparatively small  bounty hunter.  the planet holds plenty of new threats, too, such as the  lava-dwelling serpent that acts as the first line of defense in kraid's  lair and the armored larvae that lurk in the deepest sections of  norfair.  the space pirates are no pushovers either, and you won't  always have the power suit to protect you.
samus aran's next adventure is a nonstop action masterpiece that puts a  new light on the heroine's first visit to zebes.  it recalls the past  and moves into the future with one giant leap.  start your thumb  exercises--you'll need to be strong to survive this fast and  free-flowing adventure.
features:

samus aran arrives on zebes in an adventure that greatly  expands on the legendary nes metroid title. 
upgrade samus's suit with classic power-ups from previous metroid  titles, plus all-new abilities like the power grip, zip line, and more. 
cool cut-scenes bring samus's incredible story to life like never  before. 
beautiful graphics and an eerie soundtrack give each environment a  unique, distinctly metroid feel.

Cursed Mountain,"standing in lhando, the eerily deserted village at the base of the        sacred mountain of the himalayas, chomolonzo, an icy chill hits your        veins. the summit looming in the distance holds the answers to your        brother's disappearance, and you plan to bring him back - dead or alive.         cursed mountain is a survival/horror game designed specifically for        wii.  players will take on the role of eric simmons as he tracks down        his brother, who went missing on a trek into the himalayas to find an        ancient buddhist artifact.  a sensible man, when eric first encounters        the angry spirits of the dead, he dismisses them as hallucinations        caused by altitude sickness.  but as he ascends the mountain, it becomes        clear that something is very wrong...  a curse has been placed on the        mountain; the dead spirits of the local monks and villagers are trapped        in the realm of the afterlife or bardo, unable to reach nirvana or start        a new life cycle.  stuck in limbo, the restless spirits are very        angry...
features 

revolutionaryone of the first survival/horror games designed        specifically for wii, cursed mountain creates a terrifying setting in a        stylized, atmospheric manner.
original settingwith advanced        graphics, cursed mountain places the player in a realistic himalayan        environment.  players will immerse themselves in the local buddhist        traditions and rituals.  everything in the game is based on real world        facts and research...except of course for the outbreak of restless souls.
vertical level designas players ascend the mountain, they will        clearly see the summit in the distance, a looming reminder of their        final destination, and they can also look behind to see how far they've        come.
innovative wii controlsdesigned to mimic the physical        aspects of sacred prayer rituals, mantras, and gestures of buddhism,        combat is comprised of gestures that release the spirits from the curse.         in addition, cursed mountain takes full advantage of wii functionality,        supporting the wii remote speaker, rumble and motion-sensitivity in a        variety of triggered action events that mimic natural movements, such as        climbing, running and balancing.
compelling storylineplayers        investigate the disappearance of their brother who vanished while        searching for an ancient relic in the himalayas. players climb to the        top of chomolonzo to discover the fate of their brother as well as to        stop the curse that's interrupting samsara - the buddhist concept of        reincarnation.
environmental hazardsas players climb higher, the        mountain itself becomes an enemy. prone to the travails of altitude        sickness and oxygen deprivation, players may not be able to tell the        difference between real enemies and hallucinated ones.

the ps3 version of this game allows you to explore and conquer 5 extra supernatural realms. defend the overlord's tower against waves of enemy attack with seven additional online multiplayer maps, including the competitive 'capture the maiden' map and 'protect your power'. the challenge pack also introduces a 'legendary' mode, which challenges you by using your most aggressive minion managing skills to complete the single-player game under exceptional circumstances.

Ecco: The Tides of Time,"also known as ecco - the tides of timeecco: the tides of time was the second game in the ecco the dolphin series, a sequel to ecco the dolphin for the sega genesis, game gear, and sega cd. the tides of time was the direct sequel to the original ecco, released in 1994, again developed by novotrade international. as with ecco the dolphin, the mega-cd version of the tides of time featured an alternate soundtrack composed by spencer nilsen. the controls for the first game were kept, and the tides of time maintained the same level of difficulty as its predecessor. new puzzles were added, such as following another dolphin around and a 'scavenger hunt' of sorts later in the game. one of the additions was the metaspheres, which could transform ecco into different animals. the transformations were level-specific, and included a seagull, a jellyfish, a shark, a school of fish, and at one point a vortex drone. 5 unique pseudo-3d levels were also added to the game. the health meter, the air meter, and the glyphs returned in the tides of time. both the ""charge song"" and the ""confusion song"" upgrades returned from ecco the dolphin and were usable from the start of the game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers,"for fans of the original shadowgate, shadowgate 64 will be a fun-filled trip down memory lane for awhile, but once the excitement of recapturing past glory wears off, the game becomes a bit boring by today's standards. those of you who aren't familiar with the original nes game and aren't fans of puzzle-driven rpg games might just want to skip this one. the game is played from a first-person perspective, putting you in the shoes of a halfling by the name of del who is mistakenly thrown into the dungeon of castle shadowgate. while you're waiting for your punishment, you find an escape route - this is where your journey begins and the story unfolds.the gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward: all you really do is guide del through the vast castle collecting just about anything that you can get your hands on. each and every item you come into contact with has a place or purpose, although more often than not those places or purposes are a little strange. each item and area you enter come with a little description that gives you more insight than you might get at first glance. in addition, you come across lots and lots of books that explain various things about the world you're in - some books are practical and to the point, offering valuable instructions, while others are more elusive in the clues they give.visually, the game is well below the average of anything we've seen on the n64 in quite a while. the game has the flat, grainy, washed-out look of a first-generation title. aside from a few characters that you encounter, the game is literally devoid of any animation at all. in some of the areas it is hard to tell that objects you should be interacting with are even there. most of the objects you pick up look fairly representative of what they are supposed to be, although there are a few instances where you're not quite sure what it is until the written description pops up on the screen. from an audio standpoint, shadowgate 64 isn't anything all that great. the music, while fitting, changes when you go from areas like the sewers to the library, and even then it sounds pretty much the same. the sound effects of different objects like the clanging of a pipe against a wall or the turn of one of the pages in a book sound rather authentic and breathe add a bit of life into the otherwise uneventful game. in the end, shadowgate 64 is a very slow-paced game that has a lot of nostalgic value for fans of the original game, but it soon becomes increasingly frustrating and uninteresting. i personally enjoyed the game for the first few hours, but once i started coming across puzzles that were similar to ones i had already done, the game began to get stale. the lack of any prolonged contact with other characters in the game and the repetitive musical score doesn't only make the game feel boring but lonely as well. i would have to say that only hard-core rpg fans who have lots of patience should spend the time playing shadowgate 64.

Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments,"since early 2000, the sherlock holmes series of six video games for pc  captivated millions of players around the world. in 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--the testament of sherlock  holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and pcs. the title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. the new sherlock holmes game  crimes and punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. for  the first time ever, frogwares studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. the latest adventures of sherlock holmes will be  developed on epic?s unreal engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. unlike the previous adventures of sherlock  holmes, in crimes and punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. it is now your turn to truly  become sherlock holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  conan doyle?s novels. each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. all decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. you will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as crimes and punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. crimes and punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. in  crimes and punishments, players will embody a sherlock holmes with a  brand new look. developers at frogwares have abandoned the classic  sherlock holmes inspired by the 60s sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments,"since early 2000, the sherlock holmes series of six video games for pc  captivated millions of players around the world. in 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--the testament of sherlock  holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and pcs. the title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. the new sherlock holmes game  crimes and punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. for  the first time ever, frogwares studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. the latest adventures of sherlock holmes will be  developed on epic?s unreal engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. unlike the previous adventures of sherlock  holmes, in crimes and punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. it is now your turn to truly  become sherlock holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  conan doyle?s novels. each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. all decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. you will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as crimes and punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. crimes and punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. in  crimes and punishments, players will embody a sherlock holmes with a  brand new look. developers at frogwares have abandoned the classic  sherlock holmes inspired by the 60s sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

American McGee presents ScrapLand,"scrapland is a third person action-adventure game set in a stunningly beautiful and futuristic world occupied by an amazing array of robotic characters. the play experience is driven by a solidly engaging, sometimes humorous adventure narrative. the game mechanic combines proven gta3 style emergent action with an immersive storyline, diversity of player actions, and complete freedom of movement through the world.

throughout the game the player can: transform into any of 15 character types inheriting unique abilities, build and pilot ships with hundreds of permutations, engage in explosive combat, participate in life-on-the-line races, and freely explore a truly dynamic and living world.

the game is structured in missions whose objectives are always ""doing things"", instead of ""finding out how to do them"". that is, the player will never wonder what to do, which object he needs or which character he has to transform into to accomplish a mission; the game itself provides that information constantly and clearly. fun and challenge lie in what happens and how the system reacts when the player does what he is asked to, when he uses the object he needs or when he transforms into the precise character.
