Super Smash Bros. Brawl,"following the legacy of its predecessors, super smash bros. brawl has been one of the most highly anticipated games of the generation. departing from the classic style of fighting game and featuring a whole host of characters from a slough of nintendo games, the smash bros. series is most definitely a unique one.
super smash bros. brawl is the third game of the series that originally began on the nintendo 64 with super smash bros. in the smash bros. series, rather than whittling down a player's health meter, damage taken is measured by a growing percentage level. as the player's damage percentage increases, their character is launched further and further by enemy attacks. additionally, instead of trying to knock out a player by eliminating their health, one tries to knock the player off the arena, much like in sumo wrestling.
in brawl, this gameplay is that much more intense. featuring a total of thirty-five characters (fourteen to unlock), over thirty different stages (including a host of stages from melee, as well as custom stages!), fifty-two different battle items, and a massively detailed single-player adventure mode known as the subspace emissary. tie that in with a variety of new moves, new combat features (such as the final smash), and massively updated graphics, and you'll find that super smash bros. brawl is a must-have!

WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008,"
this year, thq's smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the wii, the nintendo ds, and the playstation 3! in addition, ps2 and xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. with many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ecw arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
gameplay:svr08 enables you take control of your favourite wwe superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  ai will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  in order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. what direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
features:

superstar fighting styles: with eight superstar fighting styles to choose from, playing wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 will never be the same. each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the superstars.
struggle submission system: the new struggle submission system gives players intuitive and natural control over their wwe superstars using the analog sticks. realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ecw presence: the life of a wwe superstar isn't always pretty. ecw invades wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 with a variety of superstars, arenas and weapons.
wwe 24/7 mode: combining the popular season and general manager modes from previous smackdown vs. raw games, wwe 24/7 mode embraces the intensity of the superstar lifestyle. multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a legend.
giving fans what they want: wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008,"
this year, thq's smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the wii, the nintendo ds, and the playstation 3! in addition, ps2 and xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. with many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ecw arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
gameplay:svr08 enables you take control of your favourite wwe superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  ai will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  in order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. what direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
features:

superstar fighting styles: with eight superstar fighting styles to choose from, playing wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 will never be the same. each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the superstars.
struggle submission system: the new struggle submission system gives players intuitive and natural control over their wwe superstars using the analog sticks. realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ecw presence: the life of a wwe superstar isn't always pretty. ecw invades wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 with a variety of superstars, arenas and weapons.
wwe 24/7 mode: combining the popular season and general manager modes from previous smackdown vs. raw games, wwe 24/7 mode embraces the intensity of the superstar lifestyle. multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a legend.
giving fans what they want: wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

SoulCalibur,"soulcalibur, the second game in the series, was set 3 years after the original and introduced a revolutionary feature, the eight-way run. previous 3d fighters had only limited movement along the third axis, with sidesteps and rolls providing useful but unsustained lateral movement. in soulcalibur, simply holding down a joystick direction causes the character to run in that direction. this gives the player a sense of freedom and deepens the strategy of the game. soulcalibur also improved gameplay with ""forgiving buffering."" buffering is executing the input for one move before the player's character has finished recovering from their previous move. it is important for executing quick strings of moves. other games such as tekken and virtua fighter have relatively strict buffering requirements, meaning expert timing is required to pull off many combinations, while soulcalibur's relatively lenient buffering lets players focus more on the game and less on the controls.

WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2008,"this year, thq's smackdown series expands once again, as it makes its first ever appearances on the wii, the nintendo ds, and the playstation 3! in addition, ps2 and xbox 360 incarnations will also be available. with many new features, core adjustments and a revamped roster - including ecw arenas and superstars - having been promised by the team behind the game, this is set to be one hell of a slobberknocker in videogame form!
gameplay:svr08 enables you take control of your favourite wwe superstars in a huge variety of game modes and match types, with the strategy you employ being crucial to your chances of victory. thanks to eight newly-employed unique fighting styles, it is essential to think before you strike and make sure that you use moves and tactics that befit your superstar's size, strength and abilities. submission artists will look to force their opponents to tap out, whilst hardcore specialists would much rather smack an opponent with a steel chair and be done with it.  ai will be smarter than ever and the game's core animation is said to be undergoing a total revamp, so the moves you perform will freely flow from one to the next - unless, of course, the opponent counters your offence, which could leave you vulnerable and prone to being attacked - therefore, the timing of your strikes and grapples is essential.  in order to give you increased control over your superstar's actions, a lot of emphasis is placed on the use of analogue control, in particular in the art of submission moves. what direction you push the analogue stick in and how hard you do so affects the amount of pressure you apply in the hold - but similarly, your opposition can use a similar system to escape the submission.
features:

superstar fighting styles: with eight superstar fighting styles to choose from, playing wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 will never be the same. each fighting style has its own unique strategy with exclusive moves, abilities, attributes and more. take the fight into your own hands and feel the power of the superstars.
struggle submission system: the new struggle submission system gives players intuitive and natural control over their wwe superstars using the analog sticks. realism and strategy are at the forefront, as players can now control the amount of pressure they apply.
ecw presence: the life of a wwe superstar isn't always pretty. ecw invades wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 with a variety of superstars, arenas and weapons.
wwe 24/7 mode: combining the popular season and general manager modes from previous smackdown vs. raw games, wwe 24/7 mode embraces the intensity of the superstar lifestyle. multiple character developement options, stat tracking and career goals will guide players toward the ultimate achievement of becoming a legend.
giving fans what they want: wwe smackdown vs. raw 2008 offers numerous updates, including new rosters, more enviornmental hotspots, improved out-of-ring action, enhanced online community support and much more!

marvel vs. capcom has newcomers such as megaman, jin, captain commando, strider hiryu, roll, venom, and war machine.
the dreamcast, and arcade versions of the game allow tagging mid battle, and the match ending only after both characters on a single team are ko'd, or the time runs out.
new, and unique to marvel vs. capcom: clash of super heros is the duo team attack, where both characters on a single team enter the battle feild to fight together.  this feature, however does not return to the sequel.
also, unlike it's sequel, marvel vs. capcom: clash of super heroes features 6 attack buttons. light medium, and heavy punches and kicks.  like the 2 games before it, it also allows ariel combat, and a unique, easy to use, but, hard to master combo system.
characters all have their strengths, and weaknesses.  it may not be the most balanced fighting game around, as hulk, for example can eleminate a character with a single, none infinity combo.  he is the only character in the game to ko a character without an infinity combo, however, not including secret characters.
this game is a must have if you like capcom games and/or fighting games, or comic super heroes.  although the dreamcast's directional pad can get in the way of complex game play.  be sure to use a play station 2 controller adapter, or dreamcast arcade controller. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Brawlout,"



brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments.









streamlined combat

rather than slow-paced defensive battles, brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.by focusing on aggressive mechanics, new players will be able to easily nail impressive combos while not feeling overwhelmed by friends who’ve had a bit more practice. ideal for beginners as well as pro gamers looking to dedicate the time to participate in the many tournaments we have planned throughout the year.







action is kept fast and fluid

advanced techniques like air dodging, wavedashes, directional influence, teching, ledge grabs or rage bursts.









vastly different combat styles

each character in brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in brawlout.







rage meter

the rage meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the rage burst or unleash hell with the rage mode. the rage burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their rage meter. if the meter fills, you can activate the rage mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.









single player modes

ai opponents are available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all:

train with advanced tutorials
practice advanced combo setups with custom settings and helpful visual aids
climb the challenging arcade towers.








multiplayer game modes

up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles:

all on the same device
each with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby (nintendo switch only)
go online to challenge players worldwide or create custom lobbies just for your friends, with custom game rules

Guilty Gear 2: Overture,"aksys games, a publisher of interactive entertainment products, announced that guilty gear 2: overture will arrive exclusively on the xbox 360®  video game and entertainment system from microsoft in q3 2008. this xbox 360 exclusive will take the frantic one-on-one fighting game series in an exciting new direction as an intense tactical action game. 
“guilty gear 2: overture retains a lot of elements that fighting games are known for, so it’s cool to see how familiar moves like the gun flame make the transition to 3d,” said michael manzanares, project lead, aksys games. “only now, you’re facing off against an entire army instead of just one character. you’ll lose (badly) if you think you’re a one-man army, so you definitely have to remember that you have your own army to command.”
guilty gear 2: overture prologue
in the far future, humanity succeeded in developing an endless energy called the ‘divine power’. but, although they were able to obtain wisdom, mankind could not cast aside their foolishness. tension among the major powers led to the creation of biological weapons that were based on that power – gears. 
justice, the only gear able to command the legions of biological weapons, went berserk and declared war on all of humanity. that was the beginning of the worst war in history – the crusades.
in response, mankind formed an order of elite knights, and with their participation, justice was defeated. with her fall, all gears ceased to function and entered a dormant state. the long-lasted crusades came to an end, and it seemed like peace had been restored.
however, true history has yet to reveal itself…
guilty gear 2: overture key features:


tactical melee action
take part in battle alongside your servants and destroy your enemies!


over fifty servants at your disposal
engage in dynamic battles by balancing resources and deploying troops to turn the tide of battle!


dual language
experience the thrilling continuation of the guilty gear saga with fully voiced dialogue!
