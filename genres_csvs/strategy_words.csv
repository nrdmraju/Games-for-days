Theme Hospital,"
theme hospital allows you to build an environment within a hospital, which will attract patients with comical complaints, illnesses, emergencies, and diseases. the game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, which is similar to that of theme park in many ways. the player has no direct control over the patients that wander the hospital, although game play largely centres on influencing their actions in one way or another.
each level consists of an empty hospital to plan and design, with set goals in the fields of financial attainment, patients cured, percent of patients cured, and hospital value. holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. when the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present.

Empire Earth,"-summary and screenshots taken from gamespot

empire earth is a real-time strategy game that spans about a half a million years of human history, the last 200 of which take place 200 years from now. so if you're the type who appreciates ambitious game designs, then you've found one in stainless steel studios' first game, which was conceived by the designer of the original age of empires. 

actually, empire earth has a great deal in common with ensemble studios' highly successful age of empires series. even the games' graphics look similar, though empire earth uses a fully 3d engine, unlike age of empires. similarities aside, empire earth is a huge game to say the least--it's much more time-consuming and involved than the typical real-time strategy game, and its staggering variety of units is as impressive as it is intimidating. 

real-time strategy is sometimes criticized for favoring shallow, action-oriented gameplay rather than strategic depth--but that's definitely not the case here. in fact, empire earth is best reserved for hard-core real-time strategy players who won't mind the game's less-than-stellar graphics and sound but will instead relish the ability to relive 14 different epochs of human warfare.

Zoo Tycoon DS,"zoo tycoon ds is the nintendo ds version of the popular business simulation game, zoo tycoon. the graphics and gameplay are somewhat similar to the first zoo tycoon game, except for the fact that the terrain types do not blend with each other like they do in the pc and mac versions.
the objects and animals available in the game are also that of the first zoo tycoon game, yet it only contains the original animals, because of the inability to download bonus content or upload animals onto a ds. other features, such as building exhibits as big as you want have also been removed due to the game being handheld.
the game has two playing options, either tutorial/scenario or freeform. tutorial/scenario mode takes the player through many short games, each with a set goal. the goals start off by teaching the basics; how to place items, purchase animals, and other needed knowledge of the game. they then progress to goals that have a set time limit and most require a certain happiness from the animals, a certain number of exhibits, etc. freeform lets players create a zoo free of time restrictions and goals.

Fire Emblem,"
 
fire emblem: blazing sword (released as fire emblem in the us and europe) is the first fire emblem game released outside of japan. it is the seventh game in the series, and is the prequel to fire emblem: sword of seals.
fire emblem is a turn-based strategy rpg in a western medieval setting, where you use swords, axes, lances, bows, and magic  tomes to launch attacks. one distinctive feature of this series is that once a character dies, they are gone unless you restart a chapter, or start a new play-through.
this game is split into 2 parts. the first is lyn's story, where you follow lyn, a sacaen sword-fighter, as she travels through the land trying to save her grandfather. this part acts as a tutorial for the game and introduces the player to all the game-play elements.
the second part has two stories you can choose from. the first is eliwood's, the marquess of pherae's son, and the second is hector's, marquess ostia's younger brother and good friend of eliwood. both stories follow the same overall story, in trying to stop nergal, but take small sidepaths from one another along the way.

Total War: Warhammer II,"millennia ago, besieged by a chaos invasion, a conclave of high elf  mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. its purpose was to draw the winds of  magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the  daemonic hordes back to the realm of chaos. now the great vortex  falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.
powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. yet  others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter  purpose. the race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the  hands of the victor.
the second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning total war:  warhammer, total war: warhammer ii brings players a breathtaking new  narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of lustria, ulthuan,  naggaroth and the southlands. the great vortex campaign builds pace to  culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike  any other total war title to date.
playing as one of 8 legendary lords across 4 iconic races from the  world of warhammer fantasy battles, players must succeed in performing a  series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt the  great vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. each  legendary lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each  race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics,  narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, lores of magic, legendary  characters, and staggering new battlefield bombardment abilities.
shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and total war:  warhammer ii will gain access to the colossal new combined campaign.  merging the landmasses of the old world plus naggaroth, lustria, ulthuan  and the southlands into a single epic map, players may embark on  monumental campaigns as any owned race from both titles.

captain olimar has just returned home, and is pleased to be in one piece. after crash-landing on an alien planet, he quickly learned that the only way to escape was to utilise the talents of the pikmin: the cutest little creatures that under his command sought out the scattered components of his beloved spacecraft. with only 30 days to complete the mission before his emergency oxygen supplies ran out, olimar will never forget the pikmin who aided him in his hour of need.
but home isn’t always as sweet as it should be, and it turns out olimar’s intergalactic employer, hocotate freight, has fallen deep into debt in his absence. as the firm’s president regales the whole sorry tale to olimar, the weary explorer inadvertently drops a trinket obtained on his travels.
when this meagre scrap of metal is valued at a whopping 100 pokos, the solution to hocotate freight’s problems becomes instantly clear.
olimar will simply have to return to the dangerous planet and take charge of the pikmin once more. after all, if things just lying around back there are worth 100 pokos, raising the cash necessary to repay the loan without a restrictive 30-day time limit should be simple. right?
two’s company
this time around, olimar won’t be making his voyage alone - his colleague louie will be coming along for the ride too. and after the dangers encountered on his last journey, olimar is sure to be glad of an extra pair of hands to help command pikmin and tackle the curious collection of hostile inhabitants that lie in wait.

Metal Gear Ac!d 2,"metal gear ac!d 2 sees snake taken captive by a man claiming to be an fbi agent. his captor coaxes snake into infiltrating a top secret research facility, but is in fact a clever trap devised by the us military and venus, a female secret agent in charge of research and overseeing the creation of a third generation metal gear mechanoid system. as snake attempts to defuse this potentially devastating project, he finds himself haunted by images from the past, and faces not only a wealth of tough adversaries, but his personal demons.while the new game retains the popular card-based combat and movement system of its predecessor, metal gear ac!d 2 enjoys a far more instinctive and comprehensive control system than that of the first game. key advances include the ability to control snake directly within 'move' modes, while changing commands are now displayed in real-time to facilitate more rapid actions within action situations. this combines beautifully with a wider range of actions, too, with familiar metal gear moves such as slinging, crawling, and fighting now all accessible - and via the touch of a button.these additions drastically broaden metal gear ac!d 2's strategic possibilities and the speed at which decisions can be made. further depth is then added with the number of cards on offer more than doubles from the original game's 200 to a massive 500. these also feature new ideas, such as 'linkage cards' which grant the player bonuses, while 'trap cards' initiate specific traps tailored to the current location when used.also key to card use is the new ability to upgrade cards to make them more powerful, while the innovative 'cover fire' system adds further depth to the game. and with so many new features included, metal gear ac!d 2 now includes a thorough tutorial mode to teach newcomers the many intricacies its stunning gameplay offers, and insights into the complex assaults the 500 cards can offer.further additions come in the form of a new 'arena mode'. akin to the 'boss modes' in previous metal gear solid titles, this pits players against boss characters from previous games in the series, and is ideal for practicing new strategies. the popular 'link mode' also returns in an improved state, with players using the psp's ad hoc mode to link up for one-on-one tag matches using personalised decks.

Stormrise,"stormrise is a post apocalyptic real-time strategy game from creative assembly, the makers of medieval ii: total war. two warring factions arise from the rubble: the echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time. units descriptions
echelon

enforcers enforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the echelon. determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the chancellor. they are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

grenades: the enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
riot shield up: the enforcers activate their energy riot shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


infiltrators the arbiters of justice, infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the echelon infantry, infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. all infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. the infiltrator always strikes its target.

thermal vision: the infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


prowlers prowlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. unmatched for their versatility, prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. echelon commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

search the skies aa mode: the prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



sai

rangers rangers perform two functions within the sai hierarchy. firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, rangers form into militia platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to sai commanders. armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, rangers are best deployed in numbers. when the rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. they can also fire sai energy charges at air targets.

sai anti air rockets: the rangers can fire sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
commando rush: the rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


spectres the silent knives in the night, spectres are a true nightmare for echelon soldiers to handle. they have an exceptional ability to control sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. the spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. the fact that spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

mind control: the powerful mind of the spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
cloak: the spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. the shimmering can be detected from up close though.
rapid slice: the spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


scorpions the sai may not be as technologically advanced as the echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around sai villages and to provide light strike power for when sai forces go into combat. the rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

sting: a ceramic shell-filled with brood acid charged with sai energy. on impact it does minimal damage, but greatly reduces the armour where the shell hit.

Heroes of Mana,"it was a long, long, time ago- even before the mana goddess was born. a great witch from a realm yet unknown brought darkness to the world. anise was her name. the odious witch was defeated by the guardians of the great tree... but legend tells that her darkness and curse seeped through realms and spread over to many other worlds.
and yet another legend has it- that when the world was still covered in darkness- the mana goddess used the sword of mana to defeat the benevodons that would lead the world to doom, and seal them into eight stones...
this is how the darkness subsided and the world was created. after completing her creation, the mana goddess turned herself into a large, wizened tree. it is told that the mana tree and the sword continue to watch the world from the forbidden sanctuary.
time has passed- valsena, the kingdom of green fields. ferolia, the kingdom of beastmen; altena, the kingdom of sorcery; wendel, the holy capital; laurent, the aerial fortress; nevarl, the fortress in the sand. the nations of the wolrd were shrouded in a peaceful but fleeting slumber...

each level consists of an empty hospital to plan and design, with set goals in the fields of financial attainment, patients cured, percent of patients cured, and hospital value. holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. when the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present.

Civilization Beyond Earth: Rising Tide,"
beyond earth extended the civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction.
after the first wave of great colony ships departed earth, the jubilation of humanity was short-lived. those left behind fell into a violent struggle over the quickly-diminishing resources on their barren home world. from this tumultuous time, four new factions arose. these newcomers were grounded not in the idealism of their predecessors, but on opportunism, resilience, ruthlessness, and above all a commitment to their own survival.
now, many decades after their first landfall on a new planet, the proud survivors of the first expeditions beyond earth look up to see the skies darkened by a new breed of pioneers.
beyond earth extended the civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction. rising tide extends beyond earth to new frontiers on the planet’s surface and beneath its seas, adding even more choices and diplomatic options as you continue to build “just one more turn” toward a new vision for the future of humanity.
features
-colonize the ocean: build floating settlements and access natural resources hidden beneath the seas of the alien planet. alien beasts with unique abilities inhabit the water and challenge the player in new ways. the ocean provides a fully replayable map, new gameplay mechanics and strategic possibilities for players to reign supreme on their new world.
-dynamic leader traits: players and ai leaders alike unlock new traits through gameplay and activate different combinations to respond to the changing world. these dynamic sets of traits also provide benefits and add to the new diplomacy system, governed by the new fear and respect attributes.
-new, enhanced diplomatic options: shape the diplomatic landscape by using political capital to upgrade your traits, change diplomatic relationships, and leverage the benefits of your allies’ traits.
-new sponsors: four new factions have been added to the game including al falah, nomad explorers descended from wealthy and resilient middle eastern states that possess a rich cultural and commercial heritage.
-new artifact system: collect and combine powerful relics to unlock new perks, unit upgrades, and buildings for your faction on the new world.
-new hybrid units: affinities are competing visions for the future of humanity. by investing in multiple affinities, rather than specializing in just one, players can unlock special hybrid affinity units and upgrades.
-new biomes: two new world types have been added. primordial worlds are rife in volcanic activity and the chaotic landscape of a world still forming. frigid worlds have cooled in their great age, their surfaces covered with icy oceans and frozen tundra.

Caesar III,"caesar iii offers multiple gameplay objectives in a richer, truer environment. players can build and maintain a thriving roman city, develop armies, defend their territory against invading neighbors, or, if they choose, take over the empire by exploiting resources and charming the emperor for power and promotion.  caesar iii builds upon its predecessor in two major areas. first, an entire province is shown on one large map for more seamless gameplay. rather than monitoring separate screens for city, countryside and battle, all of the game's action takes place on one level. this innovation makes the most dramatic difference in combat. instead of sending troops off to an anonymous battlefield, there will be street-to-street fighting if the player's defensive measures fail. another new feature in caesar iii is that the real-time effects of almost all the player's actions are immediately visible on-screen. before, it was necessary for players to go to report screens to assess their strengths and weaknesses in various aspects of their governance. in caesar iii for example, unemployment and rioting in the city are instantly apparent, as citizens will be seen sitting around or rampaging through the streets. moreover, the player may ""chat"" with any of the countless citizens bustling around the city for useful information about the success or failure of the city the game also features a highly intuitive interface, a new musical score, and richly-detailed animations, structures and terrain elements - all of which make caesar iii a game that city-building fans everywhere will look forward to seeing on their pc.

This Is the Police 2,"




interpret the law as you see fit in this is the police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama this is the police! run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
welcome to sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. it’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, lilly reed (voiced by sarah hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga the longest journey). she’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. but everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself warren nash appears in sharpwood. and no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
just like the first game, this is the police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. it won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. just like its predecessor, this is the police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. is it an adventure game? a strategy? a simulation? a management game? a visual novel? a puzzle? it’s all of these, and more!
participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. the people of sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. the same goes for the rest of townspeople: in sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

Stormrise,"stormrise is a post apocalyptic real-time strategy game from creative assembly, the makers of medieval ii: total war. two warring factions arise from the rubble: the echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time.units descriptions
echelon

enforcersenforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the echelon. determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the chancellor. they are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

grenades: the enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
riot shield up: the enforcers activate their energy riot shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


infiltratorsthe arbiters of justice, infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the echelon infantry, infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. all infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. the infiltrator always strikes its target.

thermal vision: the infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


prowlersprowlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. unmatched for their versatility, prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. echelon commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

search the skies aa mode: the prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



sai

rangersrangers perform two functions within the sai hierarchy. firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, rangers form into militia platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to sai commanders. armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, rangers are best deployed in numbers. when the rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. they can also fire sai energy charges at air targets.

sai anti air rockets: the rangers can fire sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
commando rush: the rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


spectresthe silent knives in the night, spectres are a true nightmare for echelon soldiers to handle. they have an exceptional ability to control sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. the spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. the fact that spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

mind control: the powerful mind of the spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
cloak: the spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. the shimmering can be detected from up close though.
rapid slice: the spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


scorpionsthe sai may not be as technologically advanced as the echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around sai villages and to provide light strike power for when sai forces go into combat. the rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

sting: a ceramic shell-filled with brood acid charged with sai energy. on impact it does minimal damage, but greatly reduces the armour where the shell hit.

participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. the people of sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. the same goes for the rest of townspeople: in sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

This Is the Police 2,"




interpret the law as you see fit in this is the police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama this is the police! run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
welcome to sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. it’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, lilly reed (voiced by sarah hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga the longest journey). she’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. but everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself warren nash appears in sharpwood. and no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
just like the first game, this is the police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. it won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. just like its predecessor, this is the police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. is it an adventure game? a strategy? a simulation? a management game? a visual novel? a puzzle? it’s all of these, and more!
participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. the people of sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. the same goes for the rest of townspeople: in sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom,"emperor: rise of the middle kingdom brings city builders inside the great wall of china. leaving the mediterranean behind, the city-building series makes its first foray into the orient and immerses the player in brand new surroundings. china has existed for over 4,000 years, but its 4,000 year history has been marked with new technologies and ideas replacing – or enhancing – the old. this is the world in which the player will take the reigns of leadership and take their cities through the twists and turns of chinese history.

beautiful surroundings. a flock of pheasants with brilliantly colored feathers flies away in fear of the hunter's sharp arrows. buddhist monks leave their strikingly beautiful pagodas to enlighten the city's residents. entertainers in richly decorated costumes march down the street to celebrate the new year. these are but a few of the sights upon which the player will feast his eyes in emperor.
for the first time, multiplayer gameplay. emperor: rise of the middle kingdom offers gamers their first opportunity to play a city building game with their friends, online via the internet. a great variety of both collaborative and competitive multiplay games will be offered. players may need to collaborate in building one of china's engineering marvels, or there may be a common goal for all cities to attain a certain affluence. in competitive multiplay, players take sides – or may be a side unto themselves – and fight for sole power over china.
familiar concepts, ancient beliefs. both the chinese zodiac and the concept of feng shui play a role in emperor. players choose an animal to represent themselves while they play, and receive benefits based on that animal's role in the chinese zodiac. in addition, the concept of feng shui, the harmonious arrangement of objects in relation to their environment, must be taken into consideration when designing cities. the player achieves a high level of feng shui when his city is designed efficiently and when people are surrounded by beautiful structures.
changing times. as the player progresses through time in emperor, many of the goods and resources he depends on in one era are replaced by better resources in the next era. as advancements are discovered, efficiency increases. for example, a soldier armed with a steel sword is much more powerful than one armed with a bronze weapon, and paper money can be printed faster than metal coins can be struck.
monuments. in emperor, the player can build many of the edifices for which china is well known, including the great wall of china, the grand canal, the hall of light, and su sung's astronomical clock tower.
diplomacy and trade. players can employ emissaries to help establish trading relationships with other cities, or use spies to gather information that will help plan attacks on rivals.

Steel Horizon,"steel horizon offers players complete control of naval fleets in a series of missions within a fictional scenario featuring well-known world war ii battles. the game is inspired by popular pulp fiction stories set during world war ii, and delves into the key events and characters behind historic battles. its scenario tells of a shady third party pulling the strings to orchestrate the war, using futuristic technology to advance the carnage for their own ends.  players compete in both turn based and also real time strategy battles, plotting moves and attacks in the turn based section and getting hands on by switching to the real time combat mode where they’ll be in charge of firing and reloading the weapons. the emphasis is not on trying to blast everything that moves however, as the player will often leave their vessels exposed and in significant danger.  keeping the right ships afloat is key, as the player will need certain craft to enable to them gain new bases and increase their fleet and others, like submarines, to take out the heavyweight attack carriers of your enemy.  as you would expect with a game of this nature, it’s perfect for two-player action and the wireless connections of both machines enables friends to compete against each other. with 20 single player missions to take on and the option to customise the player’s own flagship, there’s plenty to get stuck into.
