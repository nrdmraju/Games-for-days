Tetris DS,"it's tetris like you've never seen it before!
features 

innovative use of ds stylus and dual screens 
six classic and all-new modes 
incredible artwork inspired by nintendo favorites like super mario bros. and the legend of zelda 
10 ds players can battle with only one tetris ds card! 
battle worldwide on the nintendo wi-fi connection 

everyone agrees: tetris is one of the most popular games ever. but standard mode is only the starting point of this stunning game.
touch mode -- only possible with the ds!
at the top of a heap of tetriminos sits a cage of balloons inspired by the nes classic balloon fighter. use the stylus to touch and slide the tetriminos to clear lines and drop that cage ever closer to earth. if you can get the cage to hit the ground, it will open and the balloons will be set free.
in early levels, players can tap blocks to rotate them just to fit into the open spaces. touch mode gets really challenging, though on the tougher levels, where you can't rotate the tetriminos. think hard and carefully plan your moves. there's no time limit in this brain-bending mode.
once you play touch mode, you'll wonder why no one has thought up this simple yet incredibly addictive puzzler before.
push mode -- tetris tug-of-war
push against friends locally via the ds wireless connection or all over the world via nintendo wi-fi connection.
themed to the arcade classic donkey kong, players must clear lines in an attempt to push the other player to the edge of the screen. clearing two lines at a time moves the screen down and pushes the opponent into the red zone. the frantic action leads to abrupt changes of momentum. all it takes is a few well-timed pushes to quickly end a game.
push mode can also be played solo vs. the cpu.
catch mode -- tetris in reverse
instead of controlling the flying tetriminos, gamers control a flying core of blocks. maneuvering in a classic metroid setting (you even get to destroy metroids), gamers twist and move that core to catch the tetriminos.
as pieces fall, the core of blocks turns into a mass that can grow to unmanageable sizes if a player isn't careful. falling metroids will deplete your player's energy if they touch the mass of blocks. to keep the core of blocks under control, you'll need to form a solid square, then detonate it to refill the energy meter.
catch mode is the ultimate tetris game of survival.
puzzle mode -- testing your wits
clear all the blocks using only a few tetriminos in this innovative mode themed around the game boy classic yoshi's cookie.
you are given lines of blocks and a predetermined set of tetriminos. use the stylus to choose, rotate and drop a tetrimino. each drop has to clear at least one line. often, the obvious choice isn't the right one.
there's no time limit, so you have all the time in the world to ponder your next move. with 200 puzzles, gamers of all ages will be engrossed for hours.
mission mode -- move quickly!
in this legend of zelda-inspired mode, you are given scenarios to complete, such as clear two lines at once, or clear lines with a specific tetrimino. move quickly -- if you take too long, you'll be hit with junk blocks.
you can play an endless marathon game. in time trial, clear 10 missions as quickly as possible in time trial. if your zelda-inspired heart meter runs down, the game is over.
for frantic lan fun, play mission mode head-to-head against a friend.
standard mode -- the classic, updated
this is the place for classic tetris action! gamers can play traditional tetris solo before a super mario bros. backdrop or battle others nearby or around the world!
up to four people can battle around the world with nintendo wi-fi connection and see how they stack up against others on the leaderboard on nintendowifi.com. additionally, tetris ds lets up to 10 people battle at the same time via wireless lan. all you need is one tetris ds game card and a ds for each player!
for each ten levels cleared, you'll open up a new nintendo-inspired theme. excitebike, ice climber and duck hunt are just a few of the retro themes you'll love!

WarioWare Touched!,"wario makes his mad debut on the nintendo ds with 180 all-new, factory-fresh microgames!
what really makes this game rock is the ds's touch control. whether you're slicing veggies flying through the air or ripping the clothes off a sweltering beachgoer, the touch control makes playing wario's blazingly fast microgames so simple, even a nintendo.com writer can figure 'em out.
did we only say ""touch""? sorry, we forgot mic control. yep, a karaoke-mad robot named mike is on hand to get this party going with special mic-controlled games. for the absolutely first time in video-game history, you can blow sweet nothings into the ear of that someone special or cool off a cup of hot java.
the usual gang of wing nuts
touch the latest fruits from the bizarro developers of warioware inc. (gba and nintendo gamecube). expect to make lots of spins and whirlpools to win dr. crygor's slightly unscrewed microgames. kickin' kindergartners kat and anna return with a dojo's worth of ninja scribble microgames. scooter girl mona has made a career move from the gelateria to the pizza delivery business, but she's also found time to become a pop diva and, of course, develop a whole new set of extremely cuuute microgames.
that madcap taxi-driving duo, dribble and spitz, and way-out alien orbulon return in wholly unpredictable supporting roles. old-school grade-schooler 9-volt is joined by his big brother, 18-volt, to make five-second gems inspired by classic nintendo games. this time, he's even gotten inspiration from gold digger, one of the classier offerings (not!) from warioware inc. gba.
disco heartthrob jimmy t. is back, along with his mom, dad, james (""jimmy's chick-magnet brother""), jamie (""jimmy's disco-fabulous sis""). remix masters james and jamie each spins their favorite microgames.
new software developers this time are ashley, a goth girl whose games are a ""total drag,"" and mike, the aforementioned party robot. ashley's hilarious theme song is worth the price of admission by itself.
you can also feed a special something to wario to create wario-man, who looks like one of those masked mexican wrestlers. ""faster than a doughnut! stronger than cardboard!"" (we kid you not), wario-man's boss battle challenges you to plumb the depths of someone's nose for buried treasure.
 
microgame madness
some of the many all-new microgames include:
 

shakedown knock the fruits from the trees. 
pet petter pet a dog or cat. awww! 
washed up make like a mom and scrub a kid's dirty face. 
quite puzzled slide the panels to complete the picture. 
got the chops slice the veggies, chop-chop! 
crowd control hey, you're a superstar with no time for groupies. blow 'em off! 
fresh squeezed milk the cow. 
pro bowling you get three balls to knock down the pins, which may be in strange formations. 

but there's even more bonus games! how about orbit ball, an insanely addictive game in which you jot down lines that morph into trampolines that a grinning ball bounces off of. can you put mr. goof ball into outer space? there's even a two-player table-tennis sim, in which one player swings a paddle by pressing the l button and the other uses the r button.

Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,"the intrepid captain toad sets off on his own adventure for the very        first time through a wide variety of tricky, enemy-infested, maze-like        stages to find hidden gems and nab elusive gold stars.
features:

 equipped with nothing more than a neck scarf, backpack and oversized          head lamp, captain toad finds hidden gems, coins and power-ups on his          way to the gold star at the end of each tricky, trap-filled stage. 
 captain toad isn't particularly fast or strong. he can't jump and he          has no super powers. but he knows that sometimes, it's all about wits          and perspective. 
 twist the camera to reveal hidden locations and other secrets. the wii          u gamepad offers a closer view of the dangers and hidden items in each          maze, and its gyro controls can also be used to peer around. 
 captain toad's world is brimming with life, with dangerous enemies,          tricky platforms, nasty traps and secrets to uncover. each stage is          its own puzzle to solve, and littered throughout are hidden items in          hard-to-reach places. can you help our tiny adventurer survive to find          them all?

Lumines: Puzzle Fusion,"lumines is an addictive, hip, and stylistic musical puzzler reminiscent of tetris that transcends any puzzle game to date. created by renowned designer tetsuya mizuguchi of rez, sega rally, and space channel 5 fame, this puzzle game delivers a unique gameplay experience that challenges players to bust blocks while grooving to evolving rock, techno, and pop musical scores.features

a simple puzzler: users are challenged to control a block until it lands on the ground, creating a square using blocks of the same colour. in order to delete the shape from the field, it must be larger than 2 squares by 2 squares. the larger the square you delete, the higher your score.
a unique puzzler: any expanded square regions will be deleted when the sequencing bar passes by. a player's success is determined by how far you can expand the square regions in order to delete large boxes at once.
in sync: each key action generates sound effects. the flow of the sequencing bar and the speed of the descending block are synchronized with the beat of the background music. once a block is deleted, a music file is played. the more blocks destroyed in a sequence, the better the music.
single player modes: enjoy 24 stages of graphics and music in challenge mode, race the clock and beat the odds in time attack mode, earn graphical skins and avatars as you battle cpu characters in duel mode and draw shapes with blocks in puzzle mode. 
multi-player functionality: through wireless lan technology, the user can compete with an opponent in the ""vs."" mode
multiple game stages: four stages, each with its own musical theme and sound effects, offer increasing levels of difficulty tied to beats-per-minute.
changeable skins: users can earn graphical skins as they clear various stages throughout the game. skins can then be changed to the users liking, much like a media player.
collectible characters: players can increase their collection of characters by beating cpu characters and clearing stages. they can show off their lumines skills by using the characters they've earned as an avatar, giving themselves a unique identity.

Catherine,"vincent likes his girlfriend.  katherine's pretty, smart, and  successful.  trouble is, she's starting to talk about long-term  commitment, something vincent's spent his entire life avoiding.  since  romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, vincent  meets his friends for their regular night of drinks.  little does he  know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive,  irresistible freight train named catherine.  suddenly, he's hung over in  bed next to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, unsure about the  previous night's events.  was it just making out, he wonders, or did  something more serious happen between them?  should he tell katherine?   will he ever see catherine again?  vincent's about to find that a  stumble on the staircase of love can turn into a horrific, fatal  plummet...  key features

the horrors of love--vincent's waking  fears, doubts, pressures, and growing guilt about commitment and  fidelity now gleefully follow him into his dreams, manifesting as  horribly disfigured monsters and a ticking clock.
between a rock and a soft place--the player must navigate  vincent through heavy moral decisions.  as in real life, hardly anything  is black and white.  what is the value of honesty?  what is the right  thing to do?  either way, someone's going to get hurt.  worse yet,  someone could die.
the nightmare of your dreams--under the watch of producer katsura hashino, acclaimed director of persona 3 and persona 4,  famed character artist shigenori soejima and master composer shoji  meguro create sights and sounds unlike anything else.  as unforgettable  and original as the game's narrative, catherine's visual  direction and musical score define and perfectly complement vincent's  terrifying ascent into the dizzying perils of love.
escape with or from a friend--local competitive and  cooperative multiplayer modes, in addition to leaderboards, ensure that  the many thrills and horrors of racing through twisted stages can be  enjoyed by more than one player and add hours of extra gameplay to the  overall experience.

Tetris Effect,"named after a real-world phenomenon where players’ brains are so engrossed that images of the iconic  falling tetrimino blocks (i.e. the tetris playing pieces) linger in  their vision, thoughts, and even dreams, tetris® effect amplifies this  magical feeling of total immersion by surrounding you with fantastic,  fully three-dimensional worlds that react and evolve based on how you  play. music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to  the tetris pieces themselves, pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in  perfect sync with how you’re playing.
from deep beneath the ocean to the furthest reaches of outer space  and everywhere between, tetris® effect’s 30-plus stages take players on a  wondrous, emotional journey through the universe. the core of the game  is still tetris—one of the most popular puzzle games of all time—but  like you’ve never seen it, or heard it, or felt it before.
get in the zone: includes the all-new “zone” mechanic, where players can stop time  (and tetriminos falling) by entering “the zone” and either get out of a  sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “game over,” or rack up  extra line clears for bonus rewards.
level up: over 30 different stages, each  with its own music, sound effects, graphical style and background that  all evolve and change as you play through them.








ps4 or ps4 pro (& optional ps vr!): fully playable on either a standard display (up to 4k and 60fps on a ps4™pro), or optionally in mind-blowing 3d on ps vr.
play your way: fan-favorite modes like marathon, sprint, and ultra, with more all-new modes and other features to be revealed before launch.








timeless. endless.: a player grading and leveling system as well as variable difficulty to encourage and reward replayability.

Sudoku Gridmaster,"
mastering sudoku has never been easier, thanks to sudoku gridmaster.
when you fire up sudoku gridmaster, it doesn't take long to figure out        it's a game for all players of all skills. that's why it's part of the        touch generations brand of games.
entering numbers for each puzzle is as simple as tapping a square on the        sudoku grid and then tapping a number on the 1-9 keypad on the right        side of the screen. if you'd rather write the number in, you can change        to this setting which replaces the keypad with a blank area in which you        can write your number.
to help move you on up to the more difficult puzzles, the game offers        different highlighting tools to help you work your way around the board        faster. if you tap a number in the grid twice, sudoku gridmaster        highlights every instance of that number in the 9x9 grid. this lets you        quickly recognize which 3x3 square still needs the number you tapped. a        number will appear 9 times in the grid. in the easier puzzles, this        feature alone will help you know out many squares quickly.
when you tap a square once, an orange highlight appears, lighting up the        3x3 square in which you're currently working and the lines that        intersect the square you tapped. this feature helps a ton when your        deductive reasoning skills are called upon in the medium and hard        puzzles. a combination of the two highlighting features can be very        helpful when you're trying to solve a real doozy.
the faster you complete a puzzle, the more stars you win. if you gain        enough stars, you can take a test to win a special award and open up        even more puzzles!

Breakout," handball in a prison yard? in the early 1980s, atari took this abstract concept and turned it into one of the most addictive video games of its time. by moving a paddle from side to side to volley a ball back and forth, the object was to chip away at the wall in front of you one brick at a time. you would eventually progress to thicker, more complex walls, more capricious balls, and shrinking paddles until you finally lost your last rebound. 
now on the playstation, breakout sports a refined look but still has that simple, absorbing gameplay. you'll blast through bricks, blocks, barricades, and other bizarre barriers in both single and multiplayer modes--up to four players via the separately sold multi tap. this game also features a 3-d world with power-ups, new ball types, and interactive elements. carom your ball off buildings and strange creatures to capture prizes and move through new levels.
