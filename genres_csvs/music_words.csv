Rhythm Heaven,"rhythm heaven puts the music in your hands and some rhythm in your life.        let the music move you as you tap and slide your stylus on the touch        screen to the beat of more than 50 musical rhythm games. the controls        are as natural as tapping your finger to music.
rhythm heaven features original music in dozens of rhythm-based        minigames. the music, created by legendary japanese pop-star producer        tsunku, is addictive and catchy. even though the controls are simple to        grasp, each minigame challenges the player's grasp of rhythm by throwing        in interesting beats and off-beats.
the game is controlled entirely by the stylus: tap to shake your hips in        one game or flick the stylus on the touch screen to swing a paddle in        another. it's all about tapping, flicking, sliding and holding. this        simple set of gestures combines with the rhythm of each game for a        unique musical experience. it's easy to figure out what to do, and then        the game play becomes addictive. rhythm heaven is easy enough for new        players to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time, yet veteran        gamers will want to unlock and master every game.

 simple and intuitive controls bring you closer than ever to the music          - it's as simple as tapping your finger and yet challenging enough to          keep you on your toes. 
 music games continue to be extremely popular, and rhythm heaven          delivers a new way to play. the fun pop musical beats combine with the          quirky graphics for an experience that anyone can enjoy. 
 rhythm heaven has more than 50 rhythm-based music games featuring a          catchy soundtrack composed by legendary japanese pop-music producer          tsunku.

Wii Music,"wii music includes many other modes besides the main band jams,        including several musical games and an enhanced video playback mode for        recorded jams.

play it again:use the playback mode to see your jam        recordings brought to life with dramatic camera angles.
pick up the baton:command an orchestra in the conducting        game where you’ll wave the wii remote controller like a conductor’s        baton to lead a mii orchestra through orchestrated music. make them play        quickly, slowly, strongly or gently.
ring a bell?play a handbells game where you’ll swing        your wii remote and nunchuk controllers to play your two handbells as        part of a larger ensemble. everyone on the team has a job to do: play        one of your notes only when the tune demands it.
an ear for music:take a tone quiz that tests your        musical ear by giving you challenges, like putting note-playing miis in        order from lowest to highest pitch.
bang the drum:play a virtual drum set in the drumming        mode, the one mode in wii music that also uses the wii balance board        accessory (sold with wii fit™). you’ll use the wii remote and nunchuk        controllers as drumsticks, and place both feet on the wii balance        board—which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal. 

create a musical masterpiece with up to four players. anyone can play        the huge selection of instruments in wii music with simple motions—like        strumming and drumming.

it’s easy to play improv jams. musicians in your band jam by simply        playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to        their heart’s content. play faster. play slower. skip a beat, or throw        in 10 more. no matter what you do, wii music automatically transforms        your improv stylings into great music. there are no mistakes—just        playing for the pure joy of playing.
wii controls immerse you in the music. you can play most of the        60-plus instruments in wii music using simple motions with the wii        remote and nunchuk controllers. strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar.        drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. hammer away to play        piano, vibraphone and marimba. unlike most music games, wii music        doesn’t make you use complex buttons. you only need to imitate playing        the instrument.
wii music offers virtually endless ways to make music. you choose the        song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on        classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform nintendo        classics like the super mario bros.® theme into latin-flavored numbers.        the song list is only a takeoff point—it’s how you improvise with the        songs that matters.
send your band-jam recordings to wii friends who have wii music.        they’ll see your mii™ band members, your players’ improv styles and your        instrument selections. they can watch your recordings, or play over        parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you.        improv jams can be sent back and forth over wiiconnect24 and changed        again and again.
