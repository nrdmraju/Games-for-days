Link's Crossbow Training,"anyone can pick up the wii zapper and become a master marksman in the  quick-play shooting galleries of link's crossbow training. dozens of fast-paced  stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to  defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. multiplayer modes let  players and their friends share a wii zapper to shoot for the high score.
link's crossbow training comes bundled with the wii zapper. after a few  rounds of link's crossbow training, players will be more than ready to pick up  any of the future wii zapper titles, like medal of honor heroes 2, ghost squad  and resident evil: the umbrella chronicles.
link's crossbow training contains three basic game styles: target shooting,  defender and ranger. there are 27 stages in total, and these categories  represent only generally how each individual stage operates. each stage's goal  is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. all rounds can be  played with multiple players: players pass the wii zapper around and then play  one at a time and compete for the high score.
target shooting: in target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes  as they pop up on the screen. in early stages, targets are stationary. as the  game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. hitting the center  of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without  missing earns combo multipliers. link can aim anywhere on the screen.
defender: in defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look  and aim in all directions – sometimes even in a full 360 degrees – by aiming off  screen. hordes of enemies assault link, and he must fight them off. these  battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to  defending a wagon from boar-riding bokoblins.
ranger: in ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using  the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the wii zapper wherever  they want to look. in these missions, link storms enemy encampments, fights his  way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.
the wii zapper requires the wii remote and nunchuk, housing both in a  comfortable and intuitive frame. the control stick on the nunchuk controls  player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the  wii zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. pulling the trigger fires  link's crossbow. by aiming off screen, players can turn link to face in a new  direction (again, on stages that allow this).

Gears of War,"epic games' entry into the console game space in a big way. first legitimate competitive 3rd person shooter of significance and possibly the greatest graphics to ever grace the screen of a television plugged into a console. the game is definitely gory and violent with lots of blood and splatter involved.
the story is centered around a group of soldiers or 'gears' that are engaged in a series of missions fighting their way through hordes of the locust, a race of creatures that emerge from under ground to battle the humans of the planet sera. you take the leadership of this group of gears as marcus fenix and the whole campaign is centered around squad combat and the use of cover and flanking to a significant extent.
definitely one of the most innovative (if not most) shooters of recent years, the decision to with a 3rd person perspective and the implementation of a cover system change the mechanics of the game from your average shooter and really add a lot to the experience.
the campaign component of the game is roughly 5-8 hours long and has both single player, two player offline co-op and online 2 player co-op. playing with someone else through the campaign makes it a much funner experience and brings the squad combat to the forefront even more than the game normally does.
the multiplayer game is 4 on 4 multiplayer with 4 modes:  warzone (team deathmatch), execution (team deathmatch with the ability to revive fallen comrades for a short time), assassination (killing the other team's designated leader) and annex (king of the hill).
except for annex, the multiplayer modes don't have timed respawns like other shooters do. essentially each round is a battle of its own. this makes for a very frantic and competitive series of rounds where each player's role is maximized beacause of the small teams.
online downloadable content has been added and more is on the way in the form of maps and new modes (annex was added as a downloadable) so the game has continually improving online experience.
with some of the best visuals in any game ever and really interesting gameplay mechanics, good single player levels and very addictive and competitive multiplayer game, this is a must for every 360 owner who isn't turned off by the violence.

Asteroids,"on a quiet serene evening the cosmic space patrol sets out for the usual night cruise through the boulevards of space. this beat was always the same; calm, no action and no excitement. for some reason this night feels different. shortly before 0200 hours some form of intergalactic material is sighted through the visual particle counter. the material is too large a mass to measure. it's drifting closer. lookout, it's a giant asteroid boulder and it's headed straight for the cosmic spacecraft. the only chance for survival is to dodge the boulder or destroy it. destroying it doesn't mean just breaking it up, it means vaporizing it. small asteroid boulders are equally as fatal as large ones.
whew, the boulder just missed colliding with the cosmic spacecraft, but suddenly the cosmic space patrol find themselves surrounded by thousands of the deadly asteroids. the cosmic space patrol must act quickly to save their spacecraft and spare their lives. the spacecraft is equipped with photon torpedoes, hyperspace, shields, and flip control.
the cosmic space patrol is highly trained to handle this situation. could you do as good a job as the cosmic space patrol? how would you protect yourself if you were caught in a deadly asteroid belt? this is your big chance to fly throughout the demensions of space and fend against asteroid boulders. the longer you survive, the more space hazards you'll encounter.
the object of the game is to destroy as many asteroid boulders as possible and keep your ship in space as long as possible. use your joystick controller to maneuver your ship through space and press the red controller(fire) button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. when an asteroid is hit, it may just break up into smaller boulders, or it may be completely pulverized. in some game variations you'll face additional space hazards such as satellites and ufos (unidentified flying objects); both of which may be firing torpedoes at you.

Half-Life,"in half-life, players assume the role of dr. gordon freeman, a recently graduated theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of an underground research facility whose teleportation experimentations have gone terribly wrong. the game was the first first-person shooter with a story told entirely in-game in real time, without the use of cutscenes

half-life begins with a long expository sequence that situates the player in the game's environment prior to serious action or gameplay. the player-controlled character, dr. gordon freeman, starts his day riding a tram from his dormitory, deep into the heart of the black mesa facility, where most of the game is set, on his way to the anomalous materials lab to begin work the tram ride gives players a perspective of the facility, setting the mood and serving as a vehicle for some comic relief moments. the ride also marks the first appearance of the g-man, first shown as a strange man in a blue suit watching gordon from another tram. when gordon freeman arrives at the anomalous materials lab, a front desk security guard informs him that a system crash occurred shortly before he arrived, which has complicated communications between the black mesa scientists. the player must then acquire his hazardous environment suit (or h.e.v suit) before further proceeding..

after that a lot of things go wrong..a lot of things, and it's up to you to set things right, one hell of a job.

Star Fox 64,"it is a shame that nintendo can't clone miyamoto, the genius behind the mario and zelda games. he is easily nintendo's greatest asset, and one of the most brilliant storytellers ever to work in the interactive medium. his latest effort, star fox 64, is a game designed in his tradition of greatness, and it's perhaps the best n64 game seen since super mario 64 - which is still considered by many as the best video game of all time.
star fox 64, the sequel to the super nintendo title star fox, is a shooter in the truest sense. as happens in star fox's predecessors, you fly along and blast away your enemies while powering up your weapons. but star fox 64 adds quality gameplay twists that rival the game's incredible 3d graphics. these features include multiple gameplay paths (which take you through various levels depending on how well you play, including a tomorrow land-like city, a meteor-filled corner of space, and a post-apocalyptic battleground), a submarine and a tank level, a four-player battle mode, and the smoothest 3d flight control yet seen on a console system. not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. the enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out). this game is a pleasure to look at and does the star wars-like storyline justice with a truly cinematic quality.
at any given time you have a variety of enemies to blast, and the game alternates between on-rails levels (where you are constantly moving forward on a track with 3d movement), and slightly more open levels where you can explore a limited area. while the game may be difficult to play at first, it includes a training mode to master the somersaults, u-turns, and power-ups. once you get the hang of it, the game becomes a fast-paced thrill ride through multiple levels of interplanetary warfare. and unlike any game before it, star fox 64 uses force feedback, courtesy of nintendo's latest peripheral, the rumble pak. simply, you actually feel each shot you take and obstacle you bump into.
the plot of star fox 64 pits fox mccloud against the evil andross and his crew of monkey people set to destroy the galaxy. as fox mccloud you must lead the battle against his minions. your wingmen slippy (a frog), falco (a falcon), and peppy (a rabbit) accompany you on missions and offer advice on each level - they can also help you out in a jam, but you should expect to come to their rescue more often than not. the interaction between the four main characters makes for some of the most entertaining voice-overs yet heard in a video game and proves that the n64 doesn't need a cd drive to offer a vast array of speech. in fact, a third of the game's cartridge is used for the memorable chatter, which includes such lines as ""let's show those monkey people who's boss,"" and ""oh noooo!"" which is shrieked by slippy, who's gender is, sadly, never revealed.
star fox 64 is the kind of game you will spend many sleepless nights with - even after you finish. the replay value will bring you back again and again. n64 owners who have been waiting to embark on their next great gaming adventure should run out immediately and buy star fox 64 - the graphics, sound, and gameplay all combine to create an instant n64 classic! .

the game is set in a near future, thirty years after the events of killzone 3.
the world is a very different place; two rival factions known as the helghast and the vektans live side by side in a futuristic city, divided by a vast wall.
from responding to bold attacks, to quiet infiltrations or all out combat, you will be required to adapt and think on your feet as you have to face a variety of escalating events that could destroy your home world.
a truly cooperative online shooter experience

eschewing genre conventions of broadly accessible player classes, killzone shadow fall intercept — maintaining the hardcore essence of the main game it’s built upon — embraces cooperative gameplay in the truest sense of the word. combat roles are highly specialized and highly interdependent; those who fail to collaborate will find the greatest level of difficulty.

four combat roles with extremely varied abilities
killzone shadow fall intercept’s cooperative philosophy is grounded in four different “combat roles.” the marksman is the master of medium-to-long distance warfare. the assault role is a close-combat terror. the medic and tactician fare worse in constant battle; rather, the former excels in reviving and resupplying comrades, while the latter is a master of boosting team defenses via turrets and nano shields.

Crackdown,"a sandbox game that lets you play as a sort of supercop out to clean the streets of criminal gangs. the whole game is from a 3rd person perspective and your character levels and gains points into 5 attributes: agility, driving, explosives, strength and firearms.  by using those different abilities effectively you gain experience and you are able to do a lot more. by the end of the game you'll be able to carry around huge trucks, jump over tall buildings and shoot people from very long distances like a superhero.the game shares a lot of aspects with the popular gta series, you are free to do whatever you want, you don't necessarily have to go on missions constantly and playing the game and having fun with it is the main aim of crackdown. on the other hand, the game really focuses on action and improves on the shooting and fighting aspects of gta greatly, but takes away from a lot of the side amusements that gta had. this makes this game a much more action packed, but also more shooter oriented. you move through three islands in the game with each island representing a more difficult task to clean up and eliminate gang leaders. the main story is really just the player getting briefings about different mini bosses and bosses that control differnet aspects of a gang and that you eliminate to weaken the gang further. the strange thing about crackdown is that you can go straight after the big bosses right from the start, but your odds of beating them are very low. so the player takes their time leveling their skills by using them in the huge city in different ways and eliminating smaller gang bosses to weaken certain aspects of a gang in order to allow for taking on the final gang leaders more easily.crackdown features online co-op, racing minigames, stunts and possibly the most addictive collection aspect of any game in the form of blue and green orbs. the green orbs are placed in different locations at different heights and require you to figure out the best way to reach them and also to up your acrobatics skills, while the blue orbs are usually hidden ones and are more similar to the usual collecting in other games.probably two things define this game other than that it is a sandbox game and it's an action 3rd person shooter and those are: the massive size of the world and the fact that a lot of the gameplay takes place vertically rather than horizontally. every single building you see in the game, no matter how high and impossible to climb it seems, you can climb if you are skilled or experiences enough which really adds another fun aspect to the game.the graphics also stand out as it has a sort of cel shaded look and gives the game a kind of comic book feel that was probably the aim of the developers. this is a great example of the kind of game that gives you freedom to play around and do things the way you like it, the total opposite of a linear game.

as the adult red, it's your duty to lead the embittered cowboy through the dusty, tumbleweed-strewn towns and prairies of the wild west and reduce its sizeable criminal population.
red dead revolver comes bursting out of rockstar's saloon doors with guns blazing. it's a third-person adventure that sees you dispensing hot lead justice to the hostile scumbags who want to see the vigilante living (or, rather, not living) up to his name.
red's arsenal isn't limited to his six-shooter, either; over the course of his quest you'll find over 30 different armaments, including rifles, shotguns and dynamite. the drifter only has so many hands however, so you can only keep hold of one side arm, one long arm and one throwing weapon at a time. pressing the r2 button will activate red's 'dead eye' ability, which slows everything down to a crawl, giving him the chance to take out multiple enemies in what would otherwise be the blink of an eye.

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption,"if you think you knew what it felt like to be the bounty hunter behind        the visor, think again. the galactic federation's network computer,        aurora unit, is suddenly and completely corrupted with something like a        virus. the federation believes space pirates may be behind the problem        and are soon attacked. samus and other hunters leap to their defense        only to find that the enemy they face is dark samus, armed with immense        power that no one can withstand.

 first-person perfect: players control samus by moving with the nunchuk          and aiming with the wii remote controller, allowing for a level of          immersion unlike anything they have ever experienced. it's a quantum          leap in first-person control.

F.E.A.R. 3,"eight months ago, point man and his f.e.a.r. squad were tapped to stop an unknown man who had commandeered a secret  battalion of telepathically-controlled supersoldiers at the armacham  research facility in the northwestern us city of fairport. during the  mission point man learned that the man wasn’t working alone. in fact,  the very people point man was working to destroy were his telepathic,  cannibalistic brother, paxton fettel, and his tortured and psychically  powerful mother, alma wade—products of armacham’s perverse paranormal  experiments. despite this revelation, point man moved forward with the  standing f.e.a.r. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. in a last-ditch attempt to end the pair’s homicidal rampage, the f.e.a.r. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly  accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its  inhabitants and almost all of point man’s squad mates.
for months following the blast, events in fairport have made it clear  that alma’s psychic influence survived—and worse, her paranormal power  is growing and spilling into reality. now her supernatural agony  repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her  bloodline and reunite her family. armacham’s security force remains  violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city,  and the remaining f.e.a.r squad carries on the mission to stop alma.
with the chain of command broken and point man calling his own shots,  where will his allegiance lie? with his brother paxton fettel, back from  the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave point  man’s side? with his pregnant mother alma and her horrifically twisted,  yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? or with his remaining f.e.a.r. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties point man has ever had?

the hunters
each of the seven bounty hunters in metroid prime hunters has a unique        alternate form and special weapon. which hunter will be your favorite?
samus -- samus aran is well-known throughout the galaxy as an efficient        and experienced bounty hunter. few other hunters can compete with        samus's long history of successful missions, most of which were carried        out against seemingly insurmountable odds.
trace -- trace is a kriken, one of the most hated and feared races in        the galaxy. every kriken, when he reaches a certain age, is exiled by        its clan for a rite of passage. trace is currently in exile, traveling        the galaxy looking for planets to expand the kriken empire.
noxus -- noxus is a member of the vhozon, a proud and reclusive race        that inhabit the outer rim of the galaxy. a spiritual being who walks a        harsh, righteous path, noxus has become a bounty hunter to administer        justice to the galaxy’s criminals and evildoers.
spire -- spire is thought to be the sole remaining diamont, an ancient        race of silicon-based lifeforms whose bodies are composed of organic        rock. spire travels the galaxy as a bounty hunter searching for        information on the location, or fate, of the rest of his people.
sylux -- little is known about the mysterious bounty hunter known as        sylux, other than the fact that sylux harbors an intense hatred for the        galactic federation and the bounty hunter who has helped the federation        time and time again -- samus aran.
weavel -- once a powerful space pirate general, weavel was critically        wounded during an altercation between the space pirates and samus aran.        with just his brain and spinal cord still functional, his body was fused        with a mobile life support system.
kanden -- a lab experiment gone awry, kanden was created to be the        ultimate soldier. however, stress from the neural combat encoding        sequences was more than kanden’s still-mortal brain could handle, and        left him ferocious, deadly and dangerously unpredictable.

 world interactivity: spend as  much time as you want shooting  hoops, lifting weights, playing pinball, pool,  air hockey, and slots.
 scale and variety: this game has  it all; packed with explosive fps  action, outlandish settings, vehicle driving,  and puzzle solving —  gamers will never tire of the endless fun.
 multiplayer like no other: duke  re-envisions classic modes of play  in his own hilarious and humiliating  way.  shrink your opponent and  squash him with your foot.  freeze and  shatter him.  attach explosives  to his back. roll a pipe bomb between his  legs, or just frag him  old-fashioned with a rocket.

Coded Arms,"
a new military training program, dubbed a.i.d.a., has evolved to the point where it poses a threat to humanity. the world's top scientists are at a loss as to how it can be contained, and it seems that only a team of elite hackers hold the key to solving the problem. by entering the mind of a.i.d.a. via neurodigital interface, you, as one of the hackers, must use virtual weapons to combat the virtual enemies that wait beyond. however all threat to your life is real!
thanks to the virtual reality theme, there is no limit to the imagination fuelling the ideas behind it. all the levels you explore are randomly generated, meaning you will always need to be prepared for what lies around the next corner. all the enemies faced take on surprising, often terrifying forms - your weapons to combat them are equally magnificent.
your character's abilities are enhanced throughout the various missions by picking up system files. for example, weapons are listed as .wpn, defensive items as .dfn.
the solo mission promises many original scenarios and plot twists to keep you entertained. but we're sure you'll want to try the multiplayer modes playable via psp wireless network. up to four players can take part, bringing any tools and weapons collected from the one-player missions to the party.
everything has been designed with the psp in mind, from the intuitive controls mapped onto the analog stick and buttons to the navigation screens suited to a smaller screen.
coded arms is a gripping experience you won't want to miss, a ground-breaking one-of-a kind for psp.

METRO Redux,"it’s been twenty years since the war started and ended. it lasted for  a couple of hours and did not end in a victory for any side. there were  no sides left after it ended.
the moscow metro did fulfill its alternative purpose as an enormous  bomb shelter – it did so almost perfectly. most of the people who  hurried inside at the sounds of an air raid alert survived. they seem to  be the only ones who did.
the humanity was all but extinguished in the apocalypse it brought  upon itself, its last remains reduced to hiding in holes waiting for an  unlikely miracle – or, which seems much more probable after all those  years, simply waiting for the last supplies to run out. after all, there  is little hope of ever getting out of the metro, for the world outside  turned into a poisoned nightmare where a human cannot survive without a  gas mask. having a gasmask does not make continued survival all that  much more probable – many areas are still too irradiated to enter, and  the surface in general is teeming with hideous creatures born of  radiation.
grudges and enmity are sure to arise in times of need, and in this  world they blossom like never before. the survivors, who could probably  stand a chance of overcoming all the hardships and ridding the world  above of the mutants, were they united, nevertheless break up into  antagonistic groups. these groups vary in numbers, power and beliefs,  some of them control whole metro lines, while the others are basically  independent station-cities. but, regardless of how powerful or impotent  such a “state” is, they are vying for control of the now-scarce  resources.
and this is the harsh and unforgiving world as you, artyom, know it.  you know of no other, since you were born a few years before the war and  the memories of the time when you still lived outside are vague at best  and growing ever weaker, displaced with horrors that are your daily  routine now. ever since you came to live in the metro, you never left  the confines of the station which became your home, but an impending  danger forces you to leave. you will have to brave untold dangers,  traverse pitch-dark tunnels and irradiated ruins of the once beautiful  city to find a way to help your home station in its hour of desperate  need, and, perhaps, do something much greater than that.

Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War,"
you are b.j. blazkowicz, a u.s. army ranger recruited by the osa and the allies' top specialist in covert operations, heavy weapons, and assassination. hitler's head of the ss, heinrich himmler, is twisting science and the occult into an army capable of annihilating the allies. the balance of victory is in your hands.




mission mode: assume the role of b. j. blazkowicz, an army ranger tasked with infiltrating the deepest realms of the third reich to thwart himmler's occult and genetic experiments. initially teamed with another osa operative, agent one, blazkowicz begins his journey in egypt, where he'll uncover the early stages of himmler's plans. after being grounded by anti-aircraft artillery fire, he must overcome capture and the death of his new partner as he battles throngs of the fuhrer's brainwashed soldiers and hordes of zombies in an epic campaign that spans the globe—from egypt to norway to the heart of nazi germany.
twisted and frightening enemies: including ss guards that patrol the forests and secret military installations, zombies unleashed in ancient crypts, mutant x-creatures (the products of hideous secret x-lab facilities), and the terrifying occult priest.
co-op action: the allies' only remaining hope in the battle against the insidious reich lies in the hands of two men: b. j. blazkowicz and his new partner agent one. the xbox-exclusive, split-screen co-op mode allows two friends to work together through the entire single-player campaign.
multiplayer warfare: using xbox live® or system link, the game's multiplayer modes pit players in a team-based axis-versus-allies contest for front-line domination, where multiple player classes must mobilize and work together to accomplish mission objectives. styles of play range from objective mode all the way to a team-based elimination mode. the battlefields are designed specifically for play on the xbox, and gamers can play up to eight against eight for fast and furious combat. xbox live players can invite other players from their buddy list to join their game or jump straight into the action, using xbox live matchmaking to find a favorite style of gameplay. with the xbox live communicator and full voice-masking capabilities, players can verbally coordinate attacks, communicate enemy positions, or scream for a medic.
made for the xbox: return to castle wolfenstein: tides of war delivers dolby digital 5.1 audio; new monsters, weapons, and useable items; an expanded story line, including new missions, co-op play, and full xbox live capabilities; and system link multiplayer support for the definitive xbox experience.
tactical combat: every situation is different, and players must survey each potential combat situation and decide how best to approach the combat, by using either stealth or overwhelming firepower. with a robust scripting system and life-like a.i. and animation systems, tactical combat reaches all-new levels.

METRO Redux,"it’s been twenty years since the war started and ended. it lasted for  a couple of hours and did not end in a victory for any side. there were  no sides left after it ended.
the moscow metro did fulfill its alternative purpose as an enormous  bomb shelter – it did so almost perfectly. most of the people who  hurried inside at the sounds of an air raid alert survived. they seem to  be the only ones who did.
the humanity was all but extinguished in the apocalypse it brought  upon itself, its last remains reduced to hiding in holes waiting for an  unlikely miracle – or, which seems much more probable after all those  years, simply waiting for the last supplies to run out. after all, there  is little hope of ever getting out of the metro, for the world outside  turned into a poisoned nightmare where a human cannot survive without a  gas mask. having a gasmask does not make continued survival all that  much more probable – many areas are still too irradiated to enter, and  the surface in general is teeming with hideous creatures born of  radiation.
grudges and enmity are sure to arise in times of need, and in this  world they blossom like never before. the survivors, who could probably  stand a chance of overcoming all the hardships and ridding the world  above of the mutants, were they united, nevertheless break up into  antagonistic groups. these groups vary in numbers, power and beliefs,  some of them control whole metro lines, while the others are basically  independent station-cities. but, regardless of how powerful or impotent  such a “state” is, they are vying for control of the now-scarce  resources.
and this is the harsh and unforgiving world as you, artyom, know it.  you know of no other, since you were born a few years before the war and  the memories of the time when you still lived outside are vague at best  and growing ever weaker, displaced with horrors that are your daily  routine now. ever since you came to live in the metro, you never left  the confines of the station which became your home, but an impending  danger forces you to leave. you will have to brave untold dangers,  traverse pitch-dark tunnels and irradiated ruins of the once beautiful  city to find a way to help your home station in its hour of desperate  need, and, perhaps, do something much greater than that.

Forsaken 64,"remember descent? you know, the crazy zero-g first-person shooter that put you in the cockpit of a small ship and forced you to reenact the end of return of the jedi over and over again? forsaken is, at its core, a descent clone. but stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh.the game's simple scenario is set on a postapocalyptic earth. most of the planet is in ruins, complete with loads of goodies, ripe for the taking. you play a scavenger on a hoverbike, and you'll traverse military installations, nuclear reactors, refineries, temples, and more in search of gold and crystals. this may sound like a cakewalk, but earth's automated defense systems are still intact, littering your path with all kinds of annoying drone ships, tanks, and turrets. the single-player levels in this version of the game are different from the levels in the pc and playstation versions. some of them require you to simply destroy every enemy on the level, while others pit you against huge boss ships.the weaponry in forsaken is unique. each weapon has three levels of power, depending on how many power pods you've found. the suss gun is a spread-fire weapon that quickly shoots a mess of projectiles in your enemy's direction. the trojax is a charged weapon that gains power (and sucks ammunition) when you hold down the fire button. transpulse shots can bounce off walls, making them good for surprise attacks in multiplayer games. the beam laser simply emits two monstrous beams of death. it requires pinpoint accuracy, but it does insane amounts of damage. secondary weapons include the scatter missile, which causes the victim to drop all of his weaponry. the multiple-fire rocket launcher quickly spits out tons of small missiles. the solaris homes in on its target. the gravgon missile creates a vacuum at its point of impact, sucking enemies into its gravitational field and holding them in place for you to take out at will. the titan is the most devastating weapon in the entire game and will frequently take you out as well if you aren't careful. there are also three different types of mines that will help you keep enemies off your tail and a nitro boost that will allow you to escape from sticky situations.the control in forsaken 64 is very well done. the game moves quite fast, but once you've grasped the control scheme, you'll easily be able to keep up with the action. the multiplayer in forsaken 64 is pretty well done. even on a four-player split screen, you can still make out what's going on, although long-range rocket shots get pretty hard to make. you can replace any missing players with computer-controlled deathmatchers, so you can just take on three cpu opponents instead of actually having to deal with humans.between the various multiplayer options and the great single-player mode, forsaken 64 comes out a real winner. save for rare's goldeneye 007, it easily defeats the other first-person shooters currently available for the n64.

Section 8,"section 8 is a military-themed shooter, set several hundred years in the future, but beyond the powered, armored suits, don’t expect too much craziness in the ways of technology. ballistic-based weapons still rule the day, and soldiers are still driving tanks and being dropped into the battlefield from the air. but those tanks hover, and the dropping doesn’t involve parachutes. instead, they rocket to the ground like meteors burning up on reentry into the atmosphere. technology has advanced so much, but war is still war, and you’re not going to be fighting aliens with crazy magic-like powers.
 more than just a game focused on your individual achievements, section 8 intends to re-create large-scale battles over large-scale landscapes. even though the game is more than a year and a half away from release, the running gameplay that was shown to us at publisher gamecock’s recent eieio event—powered by a heavily modified version of the unreal 3 engine—looked very smooth and the draw distance was really impressive. the developers claim that it’s already in a playable state, and they’re already battling it out around the office with some regularity. one other neat detail about the maps is that they are randomly generated. when you see the detail that’s been put into them, you’ll be impressed by that factoid. so, the game focuses on massive team-versus-team-style combat, with large capture points being fought over by large numbers of players. how else do the developers foster some awesome team play? for one, vehicles have multiple seats—more than say, a warthog—and each one can have a unique influence over the overall firepower of the ride. there will also be fairly deep character customization, from the choosing of weapons to such accessories as jet packs, shield boosters and other equipment. tailoring your loadout and working in conjunction with your teammates looks like the keys to victory in section 8.

a lot of other elements have changed though: there’s a much more intense sense of speed to the game, compounded by excellent presentation, from the fitting music and superb sound effects that make the game even more addictive and involving, to the psychedelic backgrounds and splashes of vibrant colour. it’s an incredibly short game, so keep that in mind when considering a purchase. don’t let that put you off too much though; it’s a budget title that offers a few hours of truly superb gaming and it comes highly recommended.

Darkest of Days,"
have you ever wondered what could happen if time travel was a reality? have you ever thought about the possibility of going back in time to rewrite history for the better? that possibility is a reality in the first-person shooter darkest of days developed by phantom efx and 8monkey labs.
in darkest of days, travel back and forth through the annals of time to relive some of mankind's most dire hours, when human society was at its lowest points. by fighting through terrible events such as the battle of antietam, the bloodiest conflict of the civil war, and both world war i and ii, attempt to save certain key individuals who were never meant to become involved in these truly monstrous events and thereby change human history for the better.




brand new engine: the dedicated team at 8monkey labs has created an all-new, groundbreaking game engine known as marmoset. fight through epic battles filled with literally hundreds of non-player characters (npcs) on the screen at the same time, all with an advanced ai and all without a hint of graphical slowdown and all set against wide-open environments that are lushly detailed and dynamically lighted.
compelling storyline: darkest of days is a compelling, action-packed first-person shooter, but it's not just mindless run-and-gun, blow 'em up gameplay. think about how to approach certain key battles and situations, and take care when fighting -- certain key people that were never meant to die will be marked with a special blue aura. if you kill them, you'll face dire consequences ...
future weapons in antiquity: bring a futuristic weapon back through history and kick some major butt. how differently would custer's last stand have turned out if the general was equipped with an m-16 assault rifle? while not every battle and situation will allow you to wield weapons from the future, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to unleash futuristic fury on your unsuspecting foes.

Medal of Honor: Vanguard,"to say first-person shooters based on world war ii are a dime a dozen might be putting it mildly. there are still some great ones every now and then, such as call of duty 3 on the playstation 3 and xbox 360, but even the best wwii games are getting dangerously close to having their top-notch gameplay overshadowed by the ""been there, done that"" feeling you get from doing the same or similar missions over and over again. there's no great gameplay to be found in medal of honor: vanguard, so there's nothing to hide those feelings of déjà vu that you'll get when you play it. nearly everything in the game has been done before, and it has all been done better. step 1: kill nazi soldiers. step 2: do it again. vanguard places you in the role of frank keegan, a paratrooper in the 82nd airborne division. each mission is set up with a bit of black-and-white footage narrated by keegan, followed by a brief cutscene once the mission starts. it's the same basic story from previous games, and you're not likely to give it a second thought. there are four campaigns, each of which is divided into two to four missions. you'll be fighting in italy, france, the netherlands, and germany, doing just what you'd expect to be doing in a wwii fps. you'll plant charges on enemy antiaircraft weapons, procure documents, rescue missing soldiers, clear bunkers, use bazookas on tanks, and shoot a ton of nazis. you'll get to do a little bit of parachuting here and there, but there's nothing to it--you have a tiny bit of control over where you land, and it doesn't matter a whole lot where you end up. there's no online play to speak of. this isn't a huge shock on the wii, but considering that other medal of honor games for the ps2 have had online play, its omission is notable. you can play some split-screen multiplayer if you'd like, but come on--this is 2007, not 1997. even if you can look past the clichéd mission objectives, there's plenty of other issues to bring you down. enemy artificial intelligence is atrocious. nazi soldiers exhibit no advanced tactics, unless you count ducking their heads back behind cover for a few seconds after bullets whiz past as an advanced tactic. even if they do seek some sort of cover, they'll just stick their heads back out in a few seconds so you can shoot them. the soldiers you fight with are just as brain-dead, and it's almost comical to watch your group fight the enemy--everyone's in plain sight, but nobody's hitting anything. one of the biggest problems is horrible hit detection for bullets. it routinely takes two or three shots to register a hit, if it registers at all. most weapons have terrible range, so you've got to get pretty close to your target to get a kill. nazi soldiers don't seem to have this problem and can easily hit you from any distance, through even the smallest openings. it makes it pretty tough to find cover when you can't see who is shooting you, or even discern the enemy's general location. you don't have a health bar, but your screen grows red as you get hit, so you've got to take cover to regain health. even this system, which has been used in countless other games, doesn't work very well. you're frequently given very little warning that you're getting hit and near death; sometimes just one or two seconds pass from the first shot to the last. all of these problems are at their worst near the end, when the developer tried to make up for the game's brevity (you can beat it in about six to eight hours) by making the last two missions ridiculously difficult. the checkpoints are few and far between, and you're getting shot from all angles. it's extremely frustrating and not much fun. like most of the other first-person shooters on the wii, vanguard has been saddled with lackluster controls. the basic controls are fine, and being able to look around corners is a nice touch. once you get a hang of aiming and looking around with the wii remote, you'll find that it offers much more precision than the ps2's analog sticks. but because many of your moves are mapped to the hard-to-reach face buttons of the remote, you'll find yourself accidentally moving the remote and thereby altering your aim when you try to change weapons or select a grenade. don't even bother trying to move the remote forward to melee--you almost always mess up your aim and miss. you move around by using the nunchuk's analog stick, and this works well. the problems come with the more advanced controls. the nunchuk's buttons are used to change your stance from prone to crouching to standing, but you can also do this by moving the nunchuk up or down. it doesn't take much movement to make this happen, and you'll often wind up crouching or standing up at very inopportune times. you can turn 180 degrees by moving the nunchuk quickly to the left, but if you move it to the right, you reload your weapon. needless to say, mixing these two up is an easy and often fatal mistake. thanks to some muddy graphics, it's often difficult to figure out who's shooting you. medal of honor: vanguard looks pretty much like every other wwii game out there, though it looks a little better on the wii compared to the ps2 version, thanks to widescreen and 480p support. the frame rate isn't all that fast, but it's usually consistent, slowing down only when things get really hectic. you'll fight in bombed-out villages, fields, and churches, as well as inside war-torn homes. most of these locations aren't very interesting, though there are some nice touches here and there, like when you look up in the sky and see it filled with paratroopers. very little of the environments are destructible, and outside of some decent-looking smoke, the effects aren't much to get excited about. there are lots of browns, grays, and greens, which makes it hard to discern enemy soldiers from their surroundings unless they're firing their weapons. there are some decent enemy death animations, but they often take place a full second or two late, which makes them look quite silly. probably the game's best aspect is its audio. you'll recognize the main theme from previous medal of honor games, and the orchestral soundtrack kicks in when the action gets intense. the game's sound effects are good, and while the voice acting isn't remarkable, it is helpful. your fellow soldiers will warn you to get down when you're getting shot and even point out enemy locations from time to time. with so many world war ii games already on the market, just being average isn't enough anymore. in many ways, medal of honor: vanguard isn't even average; it does too many simple things poorly and does nothing particularly well. there's really no reason to pick it up on the playstation 2, and thanks to a higher price tag for the wii version, there's very little reason to buy it for the wii, either.

about the game
 
s.t.a.l.k.e.r.: clear sky is set in 2011, one year prior to the events of the  original s.t.a.l.k.e.r. game.
a group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the  zone-the chernobyl nuclear power plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of  a catastrophe. an immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the zone: the  once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped  clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the zone  map. stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost  territories.
with the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable zone continues to  tremor with outbursts. the transformation of the zone map destabilizes the  fragile balance of forces in the zone. hostilities for the new territories,  artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. there are no  more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. the  factions war has begun.
the protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition  between stalker factions, strelok and even the zone itself. the main character  experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the zone  right up to the point from which the original s.t.a.l.k.e.r. game begins.
what new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? why do  anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the zone, and what can be done to stop  them? which faction will take the upper hand in the factions war? these and many  other questions will be answered in the official prequel - s.t.a.l.k.e.r.: clear  sky.

Wii de Asobu: Metroid Prime,"
metroid prime is a first-person adventure game. players control a bounty  hunter named samus aran who must unravel a mystery behind the ruined  walls scattered across tallon iv.
the game opens just as samus' spaceship docks on a space pirate vessel  orbiting the planet. immediately, the beautiful graphics slap you across  the face. trust us, it's a firm slap. a silky-smooth framerate  accommodates razor-sharp visuals of efficient machinery and foreign  architecture. meanwhile, a cinematic soundtrack sets the mood and eerie  sound effects thicken the alien atmosphere.
by far, the most effective visual effect is that everything you see is  viewed through samus's visor. the entire screen has a convex look, and a  digital display provides information ranging from current energy levels  to ammunition data. the most effective ideas are sometimes the most  simple, and the visor view in metroid prime makes a huge leap forward in  immersing players in the first-person perspective.
samus uses a power beam to shoot a series of locked switches, and  eventually enters a cylindrical corridor very similar to the passageways  found in the original metroid titles. when samus strides by broken  pipes spewing steam, the visor becomes smeared with condensation. later  in the demo, the visor is splattered with the internal juices of  ruptured enemy carcasses. yes, life within samus' gravity suit is a  beautiful thing.
weapon effects are equally pleasing. hold the a button to juice up the  charge beam, and you see the corridor glow and warp as the blast travels  through space. enemy animation is delightfully disgusting, whether it's  a giant parasite queen squirming from the ceiling or a swarm of  blood-thirsty critters gushing from a dark hole. take note: the word  ""swarm"" has been misused in video game reviews for years. with metroid  prime, we can use the word ""swarm"" and feel perfectly justified. the  screen fills -- fills -- with baddies, and the framerate doesn't even  blink.
in the gravity suit
of course, graphics are just the glossing on the gravity suit. no matter  how good a game looks, it won't get fired up more than once without  solid game design and user-friendly play control. in metroid prime, both  are spot-on.
how do you know if play control is good? if you don't think about it,  it's perfect. once you get a feel for the controller configuration in  metroid prime, you spend 100% of your time worrying about blasting  enemies -- not thinking about the play control.
the control stick moves samus around, the a button fires weapons and the  b button makes samus jump. press and hold the r button to enter an  aiming mode which allows you to freely look around the environment. the l  button activates an automatic lock-on feature, which makes for easy  strafing while firing at a targeted enemy.
changing weapons is as easy as moving the c-stick. by pressing different  directions on the d-pad, you can activate the different features of  samus' visor. a variety of visor modes are available including combat,  scan, thermal and more. combat is the normal view, and scan produces a  slightly magnified rectangular viewing strip in the middle of the visor.  by pressing and holding the l button, samus can scan various items in  the environment. sometimes a scan simply provides additional  information, and other times scanning an environmental element can  activate a switch or identify and enemy's weak spot.
pressing the y button activates samus's missiles, and the x button  engages the morph ball. the game switches to a third-person perspective  while samus is in morph ball form. in morph ball form, samus can roll  through tight quarters, place bombs, activate switches and much more.
exploration is key
when samus lands on tallon iv to begin her investigation of space pirate  activity, the bounty hunter is stripped of most power-ups. it's up to  you to explore the world and recover the many power-ups and weapons  which gradually open more and more gameplay areas.
although this is a first-person game with plenty of shooting action, the  heart of the experience is highly exploratory and adventurous. enemies  abound, but there are just as many elaborate puzzles to solve as there  are bad guys to blast.
for an immersive adventure unlike anything you've played before, get  behind the visor and see what's it like to be samus aran in metroid  prime.

"Shooting Love, 200X","
アーケードでロングヒットしたシューティングのパワーアップ移植版!
 

 

収録ゲームその 1　シューティング技能検定テンポ良く、数々の簡単操作 & 簡単ルールのミニゲームをこなし「ゲーマー年齢」を測定する史上初のシューティング「検定」ゲーム。ゲー ム中には、藤野社長のニヒルでシュールなギャグ演出と、ゲーム好きがニヤリとするような有名シューティングゲームのパロディを満載し、幅広い層が楽しめる ように工夫がなされている。今回の移植は基本的にアーケードゲーム「シューティング ラブ。2007」に収録された「シューティング技能検定」がベースとなる。xbox 360　版では、アーケード版には無かった「4　人対戦モード」や「新ゲーム (新検定種目) 」の追加で大幅にパワーアップをとげた。また検定種目を任意に選択し、集中的に練習も可能となっている。

収録ゲームその 2　エクスジール攻撃方法、攻略方法、稼ぎシステムなどが、選択する機体 (全 4 機体) によって大きく異なる、システム重視なフルスペックシューティングゲーム。当作は近年の縦スクロール型シューティングゲームには珍しい、当たり判定の付いた「地形」が存在するのが特徴。xbox 360 版では、「画質や処理スピードの向上」「プレイアビリティ向上」は勿論、「連射対応」「xbox live による機体別ランキング」「2p 側機体でのプレイ」「リプレイ保存」など至れり尽くせりな機能が多数実装されている。

収録ゲームその 3　トライジールremix2004 年にゲームセンターに登場した「トライジール」のアレンジ移植。「シ ンプルかつストレート」なスタイルのシューティングゲームと謳いつつも「1p 2p での機体性能差/隠し機体/隠しキャラクター & 隠しボーナス/ルート分岐」などの、多数のやり込み要素に加え、プレイヤーサイドから編み出された「ダダダ撃ち」「レレレ撃ち」「画面左下ボンバー」と いったゲームを有利に進めるための「ネタ」「テクニック」の存在も相まって、シンプルに見えて実態はかなり奥深い内容となっている。

収録ゲームその 4　-0 (マイナスゼロ) xbox 360 用ソフト「シューティング ラブ。200x」のために製作された、トライアングル・サービスの完全新作シューティングゲーム。固 定画面上に大量発生する敵キャラ、敵弾をロックオンショットのみで破壊する。単純明快なシステムに加え「破壊衝動」「爽快感」「中毒性」を徹底追求したよ うなゲームデザインゆえ、発売後「-0患者」が多数出現しそうな予感。 当然、xbox live によるスコア争いも熾烈になりそうだ。なお当作の bgm は超有名シューティングゲームコンポーザーが担当しているという噂だ。

実績について『実績』については「実績の達人」もビックリなシュールで斬新、およそ常人 (失礼！) には考えも及ばないような解除ネタからお約束系ネタまで「シューティング ラブ。200x」収録全タイトルに満遍なく入っている模様。全員期待しておくべし!!
