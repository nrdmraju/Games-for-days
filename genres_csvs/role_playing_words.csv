Fable III,"though little is yet known about the recently announced fable 3, it is known that peter molyneux's next epic will again take place primarily in the land of albion.  in this new adventure, players will witness tyranny, poverty and injustice plague their land. they will see a people divided, and they will be compelled to stand up for change.
set some years after the events of fable 2, the character will take on the role of the child of the hero of bowerstone.  the game will loosely be divided into two episodes, the first being the race to capture the crown of albion, the second being ruling albion.  as such, there will be much more far-reaching consequences for the game world as a result of the characters decisions than in past games.
whilst limited information is currently available, it appears likely based off peter molyneux's comments and hints in fable 2's dlc ""see the future"" that the player will explore a region other than albion, possibly named aurora.  there has also been suggestion that game saves from fable 2 could have an effect on fable 3, meaning your old hero's life could effect their son/daughter's life.
other announced and speculated features of fable 3 include the advent of the beginning of an industrial age for albion, in particular bowerstone, possible support for microsoft's natal, and the likely reappearence of theresa (she provides the voice over for the first teaser trailer).

- a dynamic world. quests as you know them are gone, and instead there are events. events are real time events that happen in the game, that you can join as they happen, and depending on the outcome, the world will change accordingly and a new event will be started from that.
- the personal story. guild wars 2 brings the storytelling of rpgs into the mmo realm, and has a story filled with choices that allow you to play through the game many times and see different storylines and twists every time.
- true cooperative play. any person you meet in tyria is a potential ally, as you no longer need to join a group with someone to play with them. you also recieve the same rewards in play when you play several people together as you would when you play alone, so no one can steal kills or loot from you.
- no more dps/healer/tank setups. guild wars 2 has no dedicated healing profession, and every profession is built so they can provide support for their allies. professions are extremely versatile, and this allows for a truly unique play style.

Mass Effect,"the galaxy is trapped in an endless cycle of extinction. every 50,000 years, an ancient machine race invades the galaxy. with ruthless efficiency, the machines wipe out all advanced organic civilization. they leave behind only the scattered ruins of technology, destroying all evidence of their own existence.
few believe this ancient legend. you, however, know it to be true. the fight to stop this extinction event has become the most important mission in the galaxy.
""you must act without remorse, without hesitation, and outside the limits of the law.""
it is your mission. as commander shepard of the ss normandy, you will take your elite recon squad across a galaxy in turmoil, in a desperate race to stop the return of an enemy without mercy. to stop this enemy, you must act without remorse, without hesitation, and outside the limits of the law. your only imperative is to preserve the safety of civilized life in the galaxy - at any cost. you must become the tip of the spear of humanity, for you alone know the full extent of what is at stake if you should fail.
science-fiction role-playing: perfected
mass effect allows you to create your own customizable version of commander shepard (or jump in and use the pre-created character) and plunge yourself into the center of an epic science-fiction story. choose your squad-mates, your weapons, skills and abilities, and customize your vehicles, armor and appearance - you are in complete control over your experience.
in the course of your mission to stop the machine invasion, you may choose to follow the path of the soldier, the tech-specialist, or the biotics-specialist…each of which brings an arsenal of unique yet equally powerful abilities to use against the enemy. wield a multitude of weapon types with precision accuracy…utilize your technical skill to turn enemy war machines against their creators…or unleash the full power of dark energy against your foe with devastating effects.
as you progress throughout the game you will improve your character's skills, abilities, and equipment (including weapons, armor, biotic implants and more) to ensure that you have the means to face the growing threat before you.
the role you choose to play in mass effect will have tremendous consequences on the galaxy around you. you will face moral dilemmas in which the decision you ultimately make will significantly alter the fate of civilized life in the galaxy.
the vastness of space beckons
your mission will take you into the deepest reaches of known space - and beyond. aboard your ship, the normandy, you will choose which planets to investigate, and where to take your team. in addition to the major worlds of the main story arc, you will have the freedom to visit a wide array of uncharted planets and other locations such as asteroids and abandoned space freighters adrift in space. on many worlds, take your team planet side in the mako in order to explore and find alien life, ancient artifacts and ruins, rogue trader colonies and a host of other amazing discoveries.
lose yourself in a living galaxy
mass effect combines astonishing photo-realistic graphics with innovative new dialog systems to create a cast of living characters to interact with. engage these characters in real-time conversations that allow you to immerse yourself in dramatically charged situations.
characters communicate with full voice-acting and amazing animation that displays their emotions right down to subtle nuances in their facial expressions. every wrinkled brow and slight twist of the mouth is captured to infuse every interaction with a feeling of realism.
lead your squad in intense, real-time combat
the struggle to stop the return of the machines will ultimately be a violent one. you will assume responsibility for the lives of your squad as you lead them into often uncharted, hostile alien environments. each decision you make could mean the difference between victory and disaster. although combat will take place in real-time, you will have the ability to pause combat and issue commands to your squad which they will then execute with the precision of a highly trained elite force. upgrading certain skills and abilities as you level up your character will also allow you to increase your ballistic skill - this can ultimately lead to easier aiming, more damaging use of weapons, and biotic effects with the power to turn the tide of battle in your favor.

Paper Mario: Sticker Star,"a sticky situation has never been so fun! there's trouble afoot in the        town of decalburg, where the devious bowser has disrupted the beloved        sticker fest by causing the sticker comet to explode. now royal stickers        and pieces of the comet have been flung far and wide, and it's up to        mario and his ally kersti to set things right by recovering them. this        captivating hand-held adventure will have new and experienced fans of        the paper mario series captivated as they navigate colorful 3d        environments, defeat enemies, collect oodles of stickers and items and        use them in a variety of fun ways.
 
features 

 stickers are the key to this imaginative adventure. battles are          turn-based like in the original paper mario game, but instead of an          attack menu, mario whomps on his enemies using a sticker to attack.          stickers not only serve as mario's attacks, but also help solve          puzzles throughout the paper mario universe when placed in the correct          spots. stickers can be found and collected from all corners of the          world, and the flashier the sticker, the more powerful it is. 
 mario can also spend coins to use the battle spinner, which lets him          use up to 3 stickers in one turn if the icons are lined up just right.          the battle spinner can turn the tide in a difficult battle, so          collecting coins through the game to use it is crucial. 
 paper mario: sticker star players get stronger by beating bosses,          finding items and completing side missions for other characters in the          game instead of accumulating experience points. 
 as players progress through the game, they'll find and use more          powerful stickers to boost mario's attack power. players can also find          hp-up hearts to further boost mario's maximum health. 
 the environments in paper mario: sticker star come to life in this          visually-stunning papercraft world on the nintendo 3ds family of          systems. they also contain a wide range of objects such as electric          fans, scissors and radiators that can be converted into more stickers,          which can then be used to solve puzzles or win battles as mario          maneuvers through each level.

Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars,"this was the final ""mario"" game to be released on the snes console, and also one of the strongest and unique mario titles. unlike the traditional side-scrolling mario games that were becoming common at the time square co. helped bring role playing elements and a seemingly 3-d enviroment to the mario series.the major changes to the series come in a few different forms. first of all the game is no longer as shallow as ""save the princess"". it is intensely story driven. this allows for much more depth added to well known characters such as mario, bowser, peach, and the mushroom people. the story is quite lengthy and has a few important plot twist and developments. this game also introduces a large variety of new characters into the mario universe, two of them being playable.  the second key change is the battling system. the fighting is all turn based like a traditional rpg. all characters besides having basic attacks also have access to ""spell-like"" attacks. this can range from simple jumping or fireball attacks common to mario or such things as lazer guns and elemental spells. a nice addition to the battle system is also the ability to time regular attacks to preform additional hits. this helps break the monotony of turn based battles. all in all this is a fabulous title with an enthrolling and often humorous story to play through with quite a few side quests to keep you busy for many many hours learning all you can about this new villan and his presence in the mushroom kingdom.

*game introduction 
while it's officially a sequel to the immensely popular chrono trigger, chrono cross is completely its own role-playing game with over 40 characters, a branching story line, and multiple endings. like its predecessor, the game is about crossing through time and setting things right. this story focuses on serge's quest for the frozen flame, which will give the beholder the power to bend space and time. serge wants the power to save himself from dying in a parallel universe but, as you can guess, nefarious forces are also vying for the frozen flame to suit their own purposes.
chrono cross features the stylish character designs and wondrous cut scenes that gamers have come to expect from squaresoft, but the game also has a number of gameplay innovations. though the battle engine is essentially turn-based, characters don't have to wait their turn to cast a spell or make an attack; battles are moderated by stamina. also, the repetitive battles with lesser monsters that make so many rpgs sag can be easily avoided because all monsters can be seen on the screen.

Persona 5,"the long-awaited next chapter of the award-winning persona series that fans have been waiting for!
persona 5 is a game about the internal and external conflicts of a group of troubled high school students – the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets in the game’s story – who live dual lives as phantom thieves. they have the typically ordinary day-to-day of a tokyo high schooler – attending class, after school activities and part-time jobs. but they also undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. their power comes from the persona, the jungian concept of the “self;” the game’s heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective mask and confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and use it to strive to help those in need. ultimately, the group of phantom thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the masks modern-day society wears.

the world lies on the brink of destruction. only a select few may be able to save it. 
in ages past, the world of spira experienced a golden  age of  perfection, brought about by an advanced civilization through the  use  of wondrous machinery called machina..
however, around one thousand years before the present day, a   colossal menace known only as ""sin"" appeared and sundered all before it.   though a line of summoners have since brought sin low many times, 				 		it inevitably returns in an unending cycle of destruction. in the   face of this ever-pervasive threat, the people of spira flocked to the   teachings of yevon, which tell that sin is a punishment to 						those  who relied overly on machina.
tidus is a young blitzball star that mysteriously finds himself  in  spira after his home city of zanarkand is destroyed by sin one  thousand  years in the past. believing sin to be the key to returning  home,  tidus joins a young summoner named yuna on her pilgrimage to  destroy  sin and bring about the calm.

last time she saved the world. this time its personal!
two years have passed since sin was destroyed. since  her victory  and becoming a high summoner, yuna has lived on her  childhood home of  besaid island. then one day, rikku comes to besaid and  shows yuna a  sphere. 						the recording is of him. or is it?
yuna can't tell whether it's him or just someone who looks like  him.  if it is him, yuna might be able to see him one more time. no  matter  what the truth may be, the answers she finds may change things  forever.

The Last Story,"the last story is a role-playing game, developed by mistwalker and published by nintendo,  scheduled to be released in japan in 2011.
take charge of a band of mercenaries and journey with them into an epic and cinematic adventure in the last story for wii.
the last story blends beautiful visual design with an  innovative real-time battle system and captivating tales of camaraderie.  players will explore secret-filled locations scattered across lazulis  island, the heart of a human empire and scene of an unfolding drama that  will bring hostilities between two ancient races to a head. among the  band of mercenaries under your control is zael, a warrior imbued with  rare powers and intrigued by the notion of one day becoming an  honourable knight. but as zael and his mercenary friends reach the  island’s capital city and find themselves drawn into official affairs,  they discover that honour is one quality that can never be taken for  granted.
central to gameplay in the last story is a combat system that  calls on players to take the lead in employing tactical teamwork. by  using the special “gathering” ability, the character under your control  will become the focal point for enemy aggression, freeing team-mates up  to perform specific tasks or attacks and recover their health. balancing  out your use of gathering is key, as constantly taking the hits for  your team is not an option!
the last story draws you deeper into the drama of each battle  by seamlessly blending cinematic cut-scenes with the combat, and also  keeps things flowing by having characters discuss key plot points during  normal gameplay – advancing the story without breaking from the action.  the option of using either an automatic or manual attack system means  players of all skill levels can alter the level of challenge to suit  their abilities. and once you feel confident that you’ve mastered the  finer points of fighting, there’s a whole other arena in which to test  your skills, with the last story offering cooperative and competitive  online battles for 2-6 players.
exclusively for wii, the last story draws you into a world of  beauty and breathless action, inviting you to become part of a band of  friends at the centre of an unforgettable adventure.

Fossil Fighters: Champions,"a bone to pick
in this dino-tastic adventure, players get some hands-on time to hunt        and clean fossils, and revive and battle vivosaurs. a fossil park is        hosting a large-scale tournament in which competitors enter vivosaurs        created from dinosaur fossils into competition. fossil fighters from all        over the world battle their vivosaurs against one another to find out        who will be crowned champion.

 players excavate and clean fossils. new giant fossil rocks (containing          complete dinosaur fossils) and odd fossil rocks (which are two-sided)          add to the fun of the cleaning process. 
 once the fossils have been cleaned, they can be revived into          vivosaurs, which players can then arrange into teams for battles. the          better the fossils have been cleaned, the more powerful the vivosaurs          are in battle. 
 strategy is key in battles. players must put forth teams of three          vivosaurs, then rotate their positions to maximize their power          advantage over opponents. 
 new “super evolver” vivosaurs evolve into new forms with the help of          gold fossils. 
 players can compete in matchmaking battles or upload their best team          to see how it fares against others. players can also download          additional vivosaurs and events. 
 using ds download play, one player who has the game can link up          wirelessly with up to three other nintendo ds owners within range and          cooperate to expertly clean fossils together.

long ago, the dark lord dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons  beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. centuries later, the  magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows  ever stronger. the land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a  mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore.
what they have, unfortunately, is you...
step into the dungeons of dredmor! embrace your destiny! face evil of  the likes the world has never known - the terrifying swarmies, the  undulating thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building diggles. worship  inconsequentia, the goddess of pointless sidequests, or try your luck as  a devotee of the nameless lutefisk god. cast powerful magic learned  from the dark business warlocks of the school of necronomiconomics, or  summon the viking runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with  thunder and lightning! discover the power that can be had by wielding a  bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the interdimensional  axe, the plastic ring, and the invisible shield (if you can remember  where you left it). wield shoes decorated by the dwarven glittersmiths,  all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and  embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons  with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon.
while you’re at it, be prepared to die. a lot. in hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window.
the dungeons of dredmor await. are you ready for them?

Inazuma Eleven GO: Dark / Shine,"
ten years after inazuma eleven 3,  newbie arion sherwind is putting on his raimon high soccer kit. it’s  his first day, and he’s revved up to be joining the school’s famous  football club. but after a weird kid appears on the pitch, arion works  out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called fifth  sector, the big bosses in charge of youth football. time to lace up!
after you join the  school football club, you’ll need to recruit a team – and a ‘good’ one  won’t be enough. there are two ways to shape your squad: first, you  could thrash another team in a five-a-side battle, and get a request to  join from an opposition player. you could also buy some palpack cards  from dealers. think of them as brochures for new players, complete with  stats and sign-up requirements. as you play more and more, you can  potentially meet over a thousand players, but you only get 16 slots for  your team, and just 110 for the entire roster, so pick carefully!
when  the time comes to kick off, you’ll find two match types. the first one  is an 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise,  five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific  job, like scoring a goal. you play by using the stylus to move your  player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. when you  tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use  various statistics to plan your play – dodge or tackle.
special  moves are back, as well. these give each of your players up to six,  super-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or  whenever certain players level up. even better are the brand new  fighting spirits, which increase players’ statistics and allow for ever  more powerful special moves to help you get the edge over the opposing  team.
when you’re not on the pitch, you can explore the local  area, check things out, and talk to people to get the lowdown on school  life. later on, you’ll be able to go to visit inazuma town and stop off  at places like the shopping area or the royal academy. it all looks  gorgeous in full 3d, too!
saving the raimon jr. high from fifth  sector is only part of the package, as there’s a stack of other  challenges to tackle. test your skills against up to three friends in  local play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players during story  mode. you can get new characters and items via spotpass, or use  streetpass to receive other players' team data and play matches against  them.

The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky,"modern society owes much to a mystical technology known as “orbal energy.” fifty years ago, during what’s come to be known as the “orbal revolution,” the invention of this technology and the “orbments” developed from it led to a period of rapid human advancement, birthing innovations of all shapes and sizes -- not the least of which was the airliner, or “orbalship” industry. although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.
enter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local bracer guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently.
some matters require a gentler touch than others, however. when an orbalship transporting a legendary ""s-rank"" bracer named cassius bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, estelle, and adoptive son, joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire kingdom of liberl.
and what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever...

new to luminous arc 2 is the innovative engagement system, one of the most jarring changes series veterans will see in the game.

in addition, the player will also have to decide who to include for a balanced party. do they decide to field a party of all witches? or do they rely on some of the non-magic using members of the party to dish out some damage? it will be interesting to see which strategies end up proving superior in the myriads of online battles that are soon to come...

The Lord of the Rings: War in the North,"""with his far reaching rich hand sauron might have done great  evil in the north. yet all that has been averted because a handful of  heroes stood in his path.” – gandalf the white
the lord of the rings: war in the north is a  co-op action rpg that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new  chapter in the war of the ring. snowblind studios is in the unique  position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights  to world of middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a  wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and  never-before-seen locations. the result is a journey that is both epic  and intimate, familiar yet unexpected.
action meets rpg
intense,  visceral, and satisfying combat. rich, layered, and impactful character  progression. in war in the north, you get both. find and equip the best  loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and  feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with  friends by your side. fight through the brutal realities of the war on  all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. immerse yourself and  make your own mark on middle-earth.
co-op at its core
build your  own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the  north. the survival of your group and all of middle-earth depends upon  your uniquely skilled heroes working together. you must fight together  or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of  playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. the  first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is  desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean.
an untold story
while much  attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the one ring, the  assault on middle-earth hits all corners of the map. war in the north  turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is  grounded in details within the books and various appendices. this is not  someone else’s fight. this is your own effort to forage a way through  the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours.  this is your war.

a destiny forged in the heavens
as settlers explored the dark, unknown regions of space, they discovered a celestial port that led to a beautiful and expansive system. it was the gateway to a place they dubbed “new eden.” rich in minerals and resources, new eden was bombarded with throngs of pilots hoping to stake their claims amongst fighters, pirates and corporations. millions flourished in wealth and millions more died in warfare before the wormhole suddenly closed, severing the colonists from earth – forever. a dark age fell upon new eden for thousands of years before four dominant nations-states emerged:
 
* amarr: steeped in religious fervor strong traditions, they have the oldest tradition of interstellar conquest
* minmatar: toughest of the races, their natural instincts to fight were borne out of hundreds of years of persecution and enslavement

* caldari: an entire state organized for profit and determined to seize power by any means necessary

Gothic,"against the backdrop of a landscape savaged by war, the king of the human territories must find enough ore to forge weapons for his army to use in defence against the orc hordes. the king's mines are set in a large magical sphere and are worked by prisoners captured from across the kingdom. and it is into this sphere that you are thrown, charged with the task of delivering a letter – a letter that might just mark the turning point in the war against the orcs.
the gothic world is constantly changing and evolving: events will occur that can alter the relationships between several groups of characters. npcs are fully rounded with their own daily habits and relationships: they get up, work, go to bed, chat with each other and so on. more significantly, monsters cooperate with each other and are able to figure things out; they have individual perception. some can be lured with food or noise, some will run away from bright light. some can only hear or detect movement.
each character has the ability, with the correct training, to improve particular skills as the game progresses: training with the master of the sword, for example, will result in a character displaying noticeably more skilled swordsmanship. it is so much more satisfying to witness the effect of the skills you have learnt when they are visible in your character as oppose to a meaningless number rating, improving say, from 8 to 10. these 'optical' improvements are for the whole range of skills included in gothic. the two different classes of magic (which are absolutely independent from each other) work along the same lines.

Gothic II,"the mine valley of khorinis. the glorious days of the once productive mines in this small seaside region were long over. surrounded by the impenetrable magical barrier, the slaves eked out their miserable existence in this apparently natural prison. one brave man managed to burst the bonds of imprisonment. following his own call to freedom, he ventured deep into the subterranean temples. willing to do whatever was necessary, he went out to banish evil and destroy the magical barrier forever. spurred by the hatred of men long-suppressed, the prisoners streamed trough the only pass to freedom.

no one in khorinis had been prepared for this. too long had they lived under the deceptive notion of security granted by the apparently indestructible magical dome. the small militia garrison could not put up enough forces against the onrush. after numerous bloody clashes, many captives succeded to escape and found safety in the woods or rugged mountains of the surrounding countryside.
the steadily escalating number of raids in the vicinity of the town wall and the bandits' ever-increasing boldness seemed to paralyse the whole town. angered by the militia's inability to protect their farms, some of the farmers formed an alliance with the refugees, no longer willing to pay allegiance to the king.
khorinis is facing an uncertain future. due to the farmers' decreasing production, more and more of the food deliveries do not take place, and the stocks diminish continuously.
the militia's might ends at the town gate. outside the town wall, nobody is safe from the bandits' armed raids. there is war in khorinis. a civil war. but there is something else that could not be foreseen. evil is not dead, rearing its ugly head again. but this time it is set on delivering the deathblow to humanity, and no one can stop it.

Record of Agarest War,"war darkened the skies of agarest. not a simple war between mortals,  easily ended by divine intervention, but a war that split the gods  themselves. armies such as the world had never seen before, and would  never see again, clashed in the skies of agarest, across its surface,  and even in the caverns that wound their way through its interior.
as is the way in war, many died on both sides, gods and mortals  alike, and the war left agarest broken, blackened, and dead. the gods  wept for their paradise, and in a final act of creation, sacrificed  themselves to bring life back to its charred and twisted surface.
although the gods are long dead, the withering darkness that began  and fueled their war is not. imprisoned for millennia, its bonds have  begun to weaken, and as they do, a shadow once again spreads across the  surface of the world.
born into this world perched unknowingly on the brink of the  apocalypse, a young man by the name of leonhardt and his descendants are  the last, best hope for agarest. their journey will span generations  and continents as they strive to once again bring peace to their  beleaguered world, even as the cost of their own souls.

Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand,"
from renowned producer and game designer hideo kojima (mgs2) comes boktai, the first game to use sunlight to influence gameplay! boktai follows the adventures of a boy vampire hunter named django who must overcome traps, defeat enemies, and fight through the deepest parts of dungeons to rid the world of evil. watch out for the amount of sunlight - django is stronger by day, while the vampires are stronger by night!
entering a series of vampire strongholds, the game's hero, django, must battle his way to the catacombs of a number of castles, before exposing their inhabitants to the fatal rays of the sun. it is by adding a solar sensor to the cartridge, however, that kojima-san adds an incredible twist to the game: in order to actually defeat the vampiric hordes and their undead underlings, the player must use actual sunlight to destroy them!
the idea of a light-sensitive game comes from hideo kojima's desire to combine the natural and gaming worlds in some way. as such, boktai's solar sensor encourages the user to play the game outside to stand a better chance of defeating its vampire adversaries. it also ties in beautifully with the fatal effect of light on the vampires, with exposing the sensor to direct sunlight infusing rooms within the game with deadly light, thus killing anything it touches.

"Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love","
sakura wars is a strategy rpg that features a unique sim-based story system. an in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other rpg; however, the player’s destiny in the game is not predetermined. character interaction plays a major role, and your responses to the various characters in the game can ultimately change the story content and even the final outcome.
the battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat. ground combat takes place using two-legged mechanized suits, which transform into jet fighters to take the fight to the sky. every mech unit in the game can transform from battle mech mode to jet fighter mode during combat. once transformed, weapons and movement methods will change as well. for example, the hero’s ground mode utilizes a sword as his main weapon, but in jet mode he will use long-range missiles.

Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System,"this is the japanese international re-release of final fantasy xii.
the game includes a new take on the license board system, with twelve  grids available instead of one, each corresponding to a different  zodiac sign and job. the battle system as a whole was also tweaked;  guest characters are now controllable, while pressing the l1 button  accelerates the game's speed. additionally, the game features english  voices and the widescreen 16:9 ratio support of the north american  version, as well as a bonus disc based on the one initially released  with the north american version. finally, a new mode allows the player  to hunt monsters and espers in several series of small maps, to gain  items and gil. a list of new features as below:

the zodiac job system – there are now 12 license boards, each one representing a job. once a  character chooses that job however, they are stuck with it throughout  the entire game. isolated licenses can be accessed by unlocking espers  and quickenings. 
trial mode – the party must fight through 100 stages, each one containing stronger  monsters. completing this mode unlocks new game+: weak mode. 
controllable guests – guest characters can now be controlled, and their gambits can be edited. their equipment cannot be removed. 
controllable espers – espers can now be controlled once  summoned, and their gambits can be edited. you can now use their  ultimate attack whenever you feel like it. 
speed boost – pressing the l1 button speeds up the game, making getting around much easier. 
gambit changes – there are 16 new gambits. all the gambits can be bought upon leaving barheim passage. 
item changes – new items have been added, and some of their effects have been slightly changed. 
enemy changes – enemies have been changed slightly, plus new  enemies have been added. a battle against all five judge magisters is  also included. 
magick changes – some magic has been renamed, while others have  been moved to other categories; brave and faith are now white magick  for example. not all magick can be bought, and some must be found in  treasure pots. 
equipment changes – new weapons have been added, like the excalipoor,  while others have been slightly changed. armor and accessories have  also been slightly changed. some weapons have different elemental  alignments. 
shop listings – some shops have had their inventory changed. 
mist knack (quickening) changes – mist knacks no longer take up mp. instead, they have their own mist gauge. 
mp changes – since mist knacks do not use mp now, obtaining  mist knacks does not increase mp. instead, characters simply get more mp  as they level up. max mp is determined by your job. 
new game+ – two new game+ modes are available. strong mode,  where all characters begin at level 90, and weak mode, where all  characters begin at level 1 and never level up. nothing carries over  into these new save files. 
treasure respawns – treasures pots now respawn by just moving one screen away. 
treasure item changes - some items inside coffers have been switched around, added, or removed. 
break damage limit – there is no damage limit any more. if a  character does more than 9,999 damage, the game will show it. against  very weak enemies, it is possible to achieve over 100,000 hp of damage  with a single attack.

Last Rebellion,"a joint project between nippon ichi software and hitmaker, last rebellion is an rpg with action elements. players can roam around the world field and make action movements like in an action game, but once you enterbattle you engage the enemy using a turn-based system.
battle system
during battle, different body parts can be targeted to disable the enemy. for instance, attacks to the legs will slow them down, while blows to the arms will weaken their attacks. by strategically striking key areas of the body, players can strip the enemy of their ability to fight.
setting
there are 2 main characters in last rebellion, nine (male) and aisha (female). nine is a blade, whose specialty is physical attacks, and aisha is a sealer, who uses magic spells to attack & seal enemies. the player can switch back and forth between the two during the battle. since nine and aisha share a single, the player must strategically choose which character to execute their attacks first. because of this, last rebellion is no ordinary rpg with another mindless battle system. the player must be aware of which enemies they are fighting against, and use their experience and strategy throughout the game.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy,"
put adult swim alchemy in the palm of your hand.
for edward to possess the philosopher's stone, he has to go through the        evil homunculi in the first fullmetal adventure for nintendo ds!
features

 six playable characters: edward or alphonse elric, roy mustang, alex          louis armstrong, izumi and scar 
 perform devastating melee and combo attacks 
 release powerful alchemy attacks with the nintendo ds touch screen 
 explore the fullmetal alchemist story that features the same voice          cast from the cartoon network tv series 
 more than 10 touch screen mini-games, including “whack-a-homunculus”          and “fullmetal vs. flame” 
 tons of unlockable content including talking character alarms, image          galleries, and video and sound libraries 

who knew science kicked so much butt? brawling is the formula for        fullmetal alchemist: dual sympathy, a side-scrolling action game that        puts players in the role of edward elric, the fullmetal alchemist, on a        journey to combat the evil homunculi and acquire the fabled        philosopher’s stone.
alchemy might be hard, but controlling fullmetal alchemist is easy. you        press a to attack and b to jump. players can execute different attack        combos, but make no mistake: the game's formula calls for tons of        brawling.
the most valuable attacks come from the ds touch screen. each of the six        playable characters have special attacks, and to activate them, all        you'll need to do is touch the appropriate icon on the touch screen.        edward, for example, can put up walls and produce an explosion from a        cannon. to activate these attacks, you'll just need to touch the        respective icon.
as you fight through each level, you'll occasionally come across        touch-screen challenges. you won't need to do this on-the-fly, which is        important to note. the game will stop and let you prepare for the        challenge. in one challenge, for example, you'll need to untie a        kidnapped person.
bottom linealthough this game will mainly appeal to fullmetal        alchemist fans, those who like brawlers should give it a look.

Torchlight,"word of ember blazed across the land, and the town of torchlight flared to life.
ember is the essence of magic and the keystone of alchemy; it lures the restless with promises of power and riches. miners burrowed deep beneath the dirt streets of torchlight, discovering veins of the ore richer than any found in living memory- but they were not the first to covet these mines. the miners broke through into the buried past, a dangerous labyrinth of caverns and ruined civilizations, twisted creatures and the bones of those who came before. evil bubbles up from the depths and threatens to overrun this town as it has so many others. the heart of a villain has infused the ember, and his darkness seeps through the veins. to survive, the townspeople must break the cycle of destruction; they need a champion who can destroy the evil at its root. removing the source of the rot may purify the ember, but it is a long and perilous journey. the champion must battle through rock and fire, through lost cities and ancient tombs, into the palace of the villain himself.
the adventure is set in the mining settlement of torchlight, a boomtown founded on the discovery of rich veins of ember – a rare and mysterious ore with the power to enchant or corrupt all that it contacts. this corruptive power may have dire consequences however, and players set out into the nearby mountains and depths below to discover the full extent of ember’s influence on the civilizations that have come before.
players will choose from among three character classes, and venture from the safety of the town of torchlight into randomly generated dungeon levels, with a huge variety of creepy monsters, endless variations of loot to find, and quests to complete. the endless randomization ensures a long-lived gameplay experience.(developer) ",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

the cthulhu mythos has been  fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the  largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless  stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original  publication of h.p. lovecraft’s the call of cthulhu. adaptions and  references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very  beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human  psyche: that of the unknown. now, call of cthulhu will bring the mythos  to life like never before, on playstation 4, xbox one and pc.

Torment: Tides of Numenera,"torment: tides of numenera is a game set in the world of monte cook's new tabletop rpg setting: numenera. torment continues the thematic legacy of planescape: torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer rpgs. with  torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""four pillars"" design:

a deep, thematically satisfying story. the  philosophical underpinnings of torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
a world unlike any other. the game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  in numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
a rich, personal narrative. the story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
reactivity, choice, and real consequences. the  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. you can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. most important, we won't tell you how to  play. the best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir,"neverwinter nights 2: storm of zehir hearkens back to the days of the baldur’s gate and icewind dale franchises by including full party customization, dungeon crawling, and free exploration of a non-linear game world via an overland map. the gripping storyline foreshadows the events that will take place in the forgotten realms with the coming of release this june of the fourth edition of dungeons & dragons roleplaying game.
in the aftermath of the defeat of the king of shadows, the sword coast is in the midst of an uneasy economic recovery. trade syndicates have sprung up to exploit the post-war confusion for their own ends. the player’s party will wade into this uncertain environment; in order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through faerûn by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. as they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new faction working behind the scenes: the evil, shapeshifting, serpentine yuan-ti.
in addition to trading and economic manipulation, the neverwinter nights 2: storm of zehir overland map allows players to explore the chultan peninsula and sword coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the neverwinter nights games. exploration will take players from well-known locations, like neverwinter and crossroad keep, to more exotic areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of samarach. groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the overland map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become. the 15-hour campaign in neverwinter nights 2: storm of zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.
fans of the compelling multiplayer features of neverwinter nights 2 will also be able to take advantage of new improvements to the multiplayer experience, while modders will be able to take advantage of the power and flexibility of the overland map and trading system features along with other world-building enhancements.

travel the sword coast and samarach using the open ended exploration of the new overland map.  use skills like spot and survival while on the overland map to avoid ambushes and even find hidden locales and lost artifacts.
create your own full party of adventurers. devastate your foes with a squad of fireball-flinging sorcerers, form a solid wall of steel with a party of fighters, or strike the perfect balance in your party by spreading out the classes you choose for your characters.
improved party gameplay including streamlined party conversations, a new teamwork benefit system, and powerful party feats.
the world's economy reacts to your adventures and choices. and, through trading and quests, you can expand your merchant company into a massive trading empire.
