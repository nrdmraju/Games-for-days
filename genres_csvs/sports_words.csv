Wii Sports Resort,"wii sports resort is an immersive, expansive active-play game that includes a dozen funresort-themed activities. it maintains the wide-ranging appeal that attracted millions to the original wii sports. wii sports resort is easy to pick up and play, but comes coupled with deeper levels of play that are sure to challenge even the most experienced gamers. wii sports resort whisks players away to a resort that’s full of action, while introducing an unprecedented experience in physical reality. wii sports resort comes bundled with a wii motionplus™ accessory to provide players the most realistic, immersive experience possible – the slightest tilt, turn and twist of the wii remote controller is recognized. from the moment players skydive onto wuhu island, they’re presented with a huge selection of fun activities that everyone can play.
features

wuhu island has so many things to do, there’s never a dull moment. a dozen activities await visitors: archery, frisbee®, basketball, cycling, canoeing, power cruising, table tennis, air sports, bowling, swordplay, golf and wakeboarding.
the activities use the precision controls of the wii motionplus accessory to help players come much closer to the physical reality of engaging in the actual sports. every real-world action, whether it’s a perfect drive on the fairway or a slice off the course, is meant to be faithfully replicated.
each activity has multiple fun challenges designed to keep visitors coming back for more. basketball players might compete in a three-point shootout or jump into a three-on-three pickup game. archery enthusiasts must aim for the bull’s-eye across ever-increasing distances and obstacles.
different activities use the wii remote and nunchuk controllers in different ways. for example, players hold the wii remote like a paddle in canoeing, while in cycling they use both arms to “pedal” with the two controllers. the wii motionplus accessory picks up every nuance of motion and translates it onto the tv screen.
depending on the activity, players can compete solo or against other players. some activities even let players team up to work cooperatively.

FIFA Soccer 10,"on the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with fifa soccer 09, the top-selling soccer franchise from ea sports™ is surpassed with fifa soccer 10. responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, fifa soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
an advanced fifa soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled manager mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. these enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as fifa soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa soccer 10.
 
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa soccer 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
a deeper iteration of the ever-popular manager mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

FIFA Soccer 10,"
on the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with fifa 09, the top-selling football franchise from ea sports(tm) is surpassed with fifa 10. responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, fifa 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa 10 mirrors real-world football, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa 10.
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
a deeper iteration of the ever-popular manager mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves. new game modes, and innovations to popular features like be a pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

Mario Strikers Charged,"key informationthe captains from super mario® strikers are back, joined by four new ones, and now players can create their own original teams by mixing and matching their captain with a new cast of sidekicks. all characters have their own sets of special abilities, making each one play completely differently from the others. new captain super-abilities and sidekick skill-shots add a new level of depth to already crazy soccer battles on the most unpredictable and hazard-filled pitches in the mario™ universe. each field features its own set of interactive hazards that alter game play during the course of the game.there are tons of new single-player modes, from tournaments to challenges to tutorials, but the game truly shines in multiplayer. the game features a robust multiplayer mode: up to four players can battle locally, or they can go on nintendo® wi-fi connection (by themselves or with a friend) to compete with friends and rivals. building on the frantic fun of super mario strikers, this game gets players into action only possible on wii. primary game-play controls use both the wii remote™ and nunchuk™ controllers. players use the nunchuk to control their characters and deploy items. flick the wii remote to perform the defensive “big hit” move and flatten foes. to defend against a “mega strike” goal attempt, use the wii remote to point at the screen and manually defend against multiple balls as they rocket toward the screen.game storyline: characters from the mario universe clash in a sensational battle-sport based on the original nintendo gamecube™ title, super mario strikers. in the road to the striker cup mode, players take their favorite captain and compete through a set of tournaments. players must first battle their way through the fire cup and the crystal cup, eventually reaching their goal of competing for the striker cup. the competition is fierce, and the difficulty grows as they battle their way through the tournament ladders on their way to the striker cup.how to progress through the game: there is tons of fun to be had just playing a single match in single-player or multiplayer modes, but players also can settle into tournament play in the road to the striker cup. or they can try to finish 12 of the toughest game situations in striker challenges. beating either of these modes will unlock new stadiums, new captains and player cards useful for game cheats.characters: mario strikers charged welcomes eight new characters to the field of play, including four captains (bowser and three secret captains) and four sidekicks (dry bones, boo, monty mole and shy guy). back from the first strikers are mario, luigi, peach, wario™, donkey kong®, waluigi, yoshi™, daisy, koopa, toad, birdo and the hammer bros.stadiums: mario strikers charged features 17 total stadiums. nine of them are new, each with its own terrain and set of perils that affect the game play. new stadiums include the sand tomb, thunder island, the vice, the lava pit, galactic stadium, the wastelands, crystal canyon, stormship stadium, the dump and classroom. also included are the classic stadiums updated from super mario strikers.special powers/weapons/moves/features: mario strikers charged is all about maximizing the abilities of the different characters, as each character has a unique set of abilities and skills, not to mention super-abilities like donkey kong's thunder wham or bowser's fire storm. charging a ball provides a more powerful shot for both the captain and sidekick characters. a fully charged captain shot will result in a devastating mega strike goal shot. a successful mega strike can split into six different balls, all of which must be blocked by the defensive players by using the wii remote to point at the screen. practice passing and charging the ball to increase the chance of scoring. the player can charge the ball by completing a series of successful passes and avoiding steals, or by holding the b button to charge the ball quickly. the interactive stadiums, each with its own pitfalls, make each game an exercise in chaos.nintendo wi-fi connection play: players climb the rankings boards as they compete on nintendo wi-fi connection specific to the region they are playing in. they earn ranking points by scoring goals, posting game wins and even just competing. players can earn up to 20 points total: 10 points for a win, 1 point for a loss and 1 point per goal, to a maximum of 10 points. with a positive structured rankings system, players are rewarded for playing games in their entirety, creating better online experiences for all participants. the ultimate reward is watching a player's rank climb the leader board. players are matched up with opponents of similar skill levels through a rankings-based matchmaking system. the player who has earned the most points for that day will be rewarded the title of striker of the day, and rankings reset to zero each week to restart the competition and see who rises to the top. to keep the ranking system honest, players earn points only when competing in ranked games, not when playing against friends.community: mario strikers charged will offer a strong sense of wii community, as players will be able to create mario strikers charged profiles using mii™ characters for their online identity and create a friend roster to manage their social community. using their mii profiles, players can track their progress on the ranking leader board and their performance against their friends specifically. the goal is to build a community that is accessible and friendly to new players, yet also rewarding for more advanced players.

an advanced fifa soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled manager mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. these enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as fifa soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa soccer 10.
 
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa soccer 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
a deeper iteration of the ever-popular manager mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
new game modes, and innovations to popular features like be a pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

WWE 2K16," 
the authority in wwe video games returns with wwe 2k16!
the newest addition to the flagship wwe franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new wwe superstars, divas and legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
features 
•largest roster ever: offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover superstar stone cold steve austin alongside seth rollins, daniel bryan, dean ambrose, bad news barrett, paige and finn bálor, wwe 2k16 includes the largest roster in wwe games history
-the roster contains an unprecedented combination of current wwe superstars and divas, emerging nxt talent, wwe hall of famers and wwe alumni from multiple eras
•arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator: fans who pre-order wwe 2k16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator:
-t-800 from the terminator and t-800 from terminator 2: judgment day
•2k showcase: the franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in wwe 2k16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in wwe history. along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•mycareer: the franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from nxt to wwe to earn a spot in the wwe hall of fame. in addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•creation suite: building on last year’s foundation, wwe 2k16’s creation suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including create a diva, create a championship, create an arena, and create a show. key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including create a superstar, create an entrance, superstar studio and community creations.
•wwe universe: wwe 2k16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. in addition, for the first time, superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•online: completely overhauled based on fan feedback, wwe 2k16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the wwe games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•soundtrack: players can customize their in-game music through the addition of superstar entrance music to the wwe 2k16 jukebox. additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•gameplay improvements: wwe 2k16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest wwe gameplay experience to date:
-improved controls: the controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. this change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. wwe 2k16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-new reversal system: the reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  each superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces major and minor reversals for select moves. minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. successful major reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-new pin system: the new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. if the opponent kicks out, a superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. there is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. rope breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. in line with wwe live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-chain wrestling: new positions and attributes allow players to distinguish superstars from one other. there can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-working holds: working holds are new for wwe 2k16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. just like on wwe programming, working holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-improved ai: wwe 2k16 sees big improvements to the ai for superstars, referees and managers. for example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. in addition, significant changes are included for match-specific ai, including tag team matches.
-more match types: many match types of been added for wwe 2k16, including ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-dynamic entrances: with the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. why wait for the bell? in wwe 2k16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•additional improvements: wwe 2k16 also includes an improved submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•overall enhancements: wwe 2k16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-new commentary team: for the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with john “bradshaw” layfield, new to wwe 2k16 joining returning commentators michael cole and jerry “the king” lawler. thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-visual upgrades: this year’s title features several thousand new animations. wwe superstar and diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-broadcast presentation: gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

an advanced fifa soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled manager mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. these enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as fifa soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa soccer 10.
 
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa soccer 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.

Pro Evolution Soccer 2016,"from its humble origins on psone, the pes series has leaped from  format to format, adding ever more realism as it evolved. this heritage  has been celebrated in pes 2016’s new tagline ‘love the past, play the future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core pes values in last  year’s pes 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
pes 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘best  sports game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘the beautiful game’. the series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present pes 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘the pitch is ours’ mantra. from  further integration of the industry leading fox engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of master league, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
fresh gameplay – exciting advancements reaffirming the pes series as having the no.1 gameplay.

advanced collision system – the physicality of the modern game has been realised in pes 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
aerial strength – with the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 control – in pes 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. the 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
perfect defence – performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. the ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
intelligent player ai – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
goal keeper id – in a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in catching, clearance, collapsing and  deflecting. this adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
celebration control – new for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

fundamental changes – new significant improvements across key modes and features.

new master league – the famous and hugely popular  master league sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, pes 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
new visuals – incorporating the many advancements  of the fox engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. see the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. new night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
dynamic weather – for the first time in the pes  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. the  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. this feature is applied to all offline modes  including the master league, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
human motion – seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. the new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
new ball physics – the past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for pes 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

quality improvements – many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myclub – since the launch of the mode in pes  2015, myclub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for pes 2016.  the enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. use gp acquired through matches or myclub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. build your  team, create your legacy!
dynamic wide camera angle – the new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to intelligent player ai. depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
commentary – new commentators have been  introduced for both uk and germany, with peter drury and marco hagemann  joining the pes team. an abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for master league, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
ps4 image importing – edit mode is synonymous  with the pes series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. ps4 (and ps3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

pes 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the uefa champions league club competition, which was announced  recently. this new 3 year partnership allows konami to feature both the  uefa champions league and uefa europa league club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the uefa super cup  featured within the iconic master league mode.

Football Manager 2014,"
more than 1,000 improvements and enhancements make sports interactive and sega’s tenth football manager the most compelling and realistic to date!
football manager 2014 is the most feature-packed and technically advanced release in the series’ history. benefitting from more than 1,000 improvements and enhancements over its most recent predecessor, fm 2014 is the most realistic simulation of football management ever released.
in addition to enhanced gameplay, fm 2014 also delivers a range of technical innovations, with the game available on linux for the first time and the introduction of ‘cloud save’ technology, which means that managers can now pursue a single career from any computer, anywhere in the world.
the fm experience is also more customisable than ever before, as the integration of steam workshop tools make it easy for managers to create and share customised fm content and experiences such as photo/logo packs, new and custom competitions and even tailor-made in-game challenges using the new challenge editor which has been incorporated into the free-to-download pre-game editor.
features

play      it whenever, wherever, however

play  on linux for the first time, plus the inclusion of ‘cloud-save’  technology which means that managers can now pursue a single career from  any computer, anywhere in the world. fm14 also includes integration  with steam workshop making it easy for managers to create and share  customised fm content such as photo/logo packs, new and custom  competitions and tailor-made challenges using the new challenge editor.

improved      match engine

the 3d match engine has seen extensive improvements, including enhanced ai, improved lighting and player animation, individual player character and kit models, more realistic player reaction to on-field incidents and a range of optimisations which combine to make this the best looking and fastest fm match engine yet.

tactical      overhaul

there has been a complete redesign of how tactics are created, selected and implemented with player roles and team strategies becoming even more prominent, definable roles for players for multiple positions, new player roles and instructions and improvements to rival managers' ai so that they’ll adapt their tactics more readily over time.

more      realistic transfers and contracts

fm 2014 features a revamped transfer module where opposing clubs and managers adopt a more realistic approach when making or responding to transfer offers. in addition, a number of new ‘real world’ transfer clauses have been added, such as the facility to loan a player back to the club he’s just been bought from and the option to offer a combination of cash and loan players, as well as new contract clauses such as a sub bench appearance fee. on top of this, the old ‘turn-based’ system of transfer negotiations can now be done two ways, the tried and tested system and a new ‘live’ system, similar to that used in fm’s contract negotiations.

more      sophisticated board interaction

contract negotiations are more realistic in fm 2014, as managers and boards can now make demands and lay down their respective visions for the club in both initial job interviews and contract renewal discussions. managers can also attempt to renegotiate transfer and wage budgets as a reward for staying loyal if they’ve been offered a job by another club, with the outcome helping aid their decision on whether to move or not.

improved interaction with      players, staff and media

there is now better interaction between players, managers, their rivals and the media; for example, members of the coaching staff now offer feedback on how reserve and youth team players are performing. managers can also ask key players to have a word with unhappy squad members, while the introduction of an end-of-season meeting allows the manager to let the squad know how they have performed and set targets for the coming season.

news      system

the news system has been overhauled so managers can now deal with many club matters directly from their inbox. in addition, news is now colour-coded, based on category, and contains more detail – for example, scout reports now appear as a single news item with a top-line report on all players scouted and the facility to shortlist or make an offer for each of these players.

enhanced      user interface

major changes have been made to fm 2014’s user interface. key areas have been redesigned – including the training overview page, the transfer centre and the news homepage – while widespread changes have been made across the game’s user interface. the language employed throughout the game has also enjoyed a major overhaul and now corresponds more closely to the language of real world football.

football      manager classic evolved

managers can now choose more than three playable nations in classic mode for a more immersive experience. in addition, fm’s ‘fast play’ mode now includes transfer deadline day, a match plan wizard and new unlockables.

MLB 10: The Show,"widely considered the most authentic baseball game available, mlb 10 the show is set again to provide fans with the best baseball experience this console generation with even more features and modes destine to quicken the heart, raise the stakes, and hurl you further into a true mlb baseball experience.  holding more than 81% market share on ps3, more than 70% market share across all playstation platforms, and the #1 selling baseball franchise in video game history, the show is proving once again to be the industry’s premier licensed major league baseball (mlb) game, both critically and commercially. 
the long awaited home run derby leads the deep features list in mlb 10 the show for ps3.  fully implemented in the season modes and available as a stand alone feature, home run derby follows the current mlb rules and flow.  the mlb all-star futures game will also be available within season modes in its correct timeframe (just before the home run derby), as well as fully functional online leagues.
additional new features for the ps3 game include “catcher mode,” the ability to call the game as the catcher, select pitches, and be the ultimate field general, just like joe mauer.  mlb 10 the show will also offer daytime transitional lighting, a newly added “movie maker” menu giving the user the ability to select multiple replays to add to and edit a single movie, and 11 new stadiums.  five new minor league stadiums will be introduced, as well as a selection of classic parks available on the ps3 for the first time including forbes field, crosley field, the polo grounds, shibe park, sportsman park, and griffith stadium.
online multiplayer has vastly improved this year to bring more of that competitive fire out amongst friends.   first and foremost, the game will detect and respond better to adverse network conditions and bandwidth has been reduced to help the speed and flow of online gameplay.  along with the core online league play, where gamers can customize leagues including choosing players, teams, and length of schedule, mlb 10 the show will now offer fully functional online season leagues!  the new online season leagues will save and display mlb player stats, track player energy, allow for trades/injuries, and offer 40-man roster functionality.  alongside this will be weekly live roster updates, available every week throughout the entire mlb season, tracking roster changes, addition of new mlb players (with correct attributes), and player attribute updates to reflect hot and cold streaks.  lastly, the show will offer the ability to view every game you've ever played online, complete with opponents, box scores, and game logs.  there is simply no better place to turn up the smacktalk and settle a little baseball rivalry than playing it out online in the show.
the gameplay in the show has been enhanced considerably with improved logic, animations and presentations resulting in a wider variety of hit types (including more choppers), improved ground ball friction, improved run down logic, and upgrades to the throwing meter, which will reflect each player’s arm strength based on attributes.  the ground ball friction will provide more realistic bounces and ground balls getting by the corner infielders when hit down either foul line allowing for extra bases when the ball rattles around in the left and right field corners.  ball collision improvements now enable the ball to bounce off of any part of the batter's body and take the correct trajectory after impact.  if you dive for a ball and miss it, the ball can be smothered, kicked, and deflected, all outcomes following real life ball physics.  comebackers to the mound can deflect off the pitcher’s body who can then turn a great looking 1-6-3 double play.  we have also added the always popular 3-6-3 double play, ability to rob hrs, dives, sliding catch plays, tumbles, rolls, over running bases, getting caught on a pick-off move when leaning the wrong way, base runner line drive reactions, multiple levels of check swings, and umpire reviews of hrs hit down the foul lines (they can get reversed!)—all new aspects of the gameplay that not only look great, but feel right.
mlb 10 the show once again raises the overall level of detail and realism from customizable fan chants, to jumbotron animations, to crowd atmosphere.  not to be outdone, stadium ambiance will be improved with the addition of hr/splash counters, fireworks, steam, noisemakers, towels, thunder sticks, crowd reaching over the rails, and crowd detail, such as interaction with vendors and placing ks.  mascots are also available for all teams and each will show off signature moves throughout the game.
the popular “road to the show” mode returns with version 4.0 featuring the addition of two new interactive training modes, new settings, and new presentations.  interactive training will consist of a set of mini-games designed to improve a player’s fielding and pitching ability, adding to last year's introduction of batting and base running training.  in road to the show users will also have the new game watch and game completion options which allow the player to set how much of the game they wish to view.  “franchise mode” also returns to the game, including the 40-man roster, salary arbitration, waiver transactions and september call-ups.  due to hit stores in march 2010, just in time for spring training, as the only officially licensed first party videogame exclusively for the playstation 3 (ps3), playstation 2, psp (playstation portable), and the psp (playstation portable) go, mlb 10 the show is prepared to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience for all fans, new and old.

pitching confidence meter – the ultimate pitcher/batter interface returns. additionally, pitcher confidence plays a role in a gamer’s ability to hit release points in the all-new pitch meter, while frequency of mistakes will impact the confidence level of a gamer’s hurler, making it more difficult to paint the corners of the strike zone.
guess pitch – baseball fans can attempt to master the ability to knock one out or hit the grounder to advance the runner by checking pitch history and correctly guessing which pitch and location that the pitcher will throw next.  if a correct pitch is selected, the power attribute is increased to give the batter a higher chance of hitting one out of the park. 
playmaker fielding – based on fielding attributes, but it’s ultimately up to each player to decide how to play to each team’s strengths and weaknesses.  excellent fielders will track down the ball for you while sub-par fielders will require some concentration.

3-man booth & progressive commentary – rex hudler, matt vasgersian, and dave campbell return to provide the most comprehensive commentary available.  additionally, the game’s progressive commentary system changes dialogue by adapting to current actions and situations.

WWE 2K16," 
the authority in wwe video games returns with wwe 2k16!
the newest addition to the flagship wwe franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new wwe superstars, divas and legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
features 
•largest roster ever: offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover superstar stone cold steve austin alongside seth rollins, daniel bryan, dean ambrose, bad news barrett, paige and finn bálor, wwe 2k16 includes the largest roster in wwe games history
-the roster contains an unprecedented combination of current wwe superstars and divas, emerging nxt talent, wwe hall of famers and wwe alumni from multiple eras
•arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator: fans who pre-order wwe 2k16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator:
-t-800 from the terminator and t-800 from terminator 2: judgment day
•2k showcase: the franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in wwe 2k16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in wwe history. along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•mycareer: the franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from nxt to wwe to earn a spot in the wwe hall of fame. in addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•creation suite: building on last year’s foundation, wwe 2k16’s creation suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including create a diva, create a championship, create an arena, and create a show. key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including create a superstar, create an entrance, superstar studio and community creations.
•wwe universe: wwe 2k16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. in addition, for the first time, superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•online: completely overhauled based on fan feedback, wwe 2k16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the wwe games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•soundtrack: players can customize their in-game music through the addition of superstar entrance music to the wwe 2k16 jukebox. additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•gameplay improvements: wwe 2k16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest wwe gameplay experience to date:
-improved controls: the controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. this change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. wwe 2k16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-new reversal system: the reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  each superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces major and minor reversals for select moves. minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. successful major reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-new pin system: the new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. if the opponent kicks out, a superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. there is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. rope breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. in line with wwe live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-chain wrestling: new positions and attributes allow players to distinguish superstars from one other. there can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-working holds: working holds are new for wwe 2k16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. just like on wwe programming, working holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-improved ai: wwe 2k16 sees big improvements to the ai for superstars, referees and managers. for example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. in addition, significant changes are included for match-specific ai, including tag team matches.
-more match types: many match types of been added for wwe 2k16, including ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-dynamic entrances: with the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. why wait for the bell? in wwe 2k16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•additional improvements: wwe 2k16 also includes an improved submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•overall enhancements: wwe 2k16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-new commentary team: for the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with john “bradshaw” layfield, new to wwe 2k16 joining returning commentators michael cole and jerry “the king” lawler. thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-visual upgrades: this year’s title features several thousand new animations. wwe superstar and diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-broadcast presentation: gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

FIFA Soccer 10,"on the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with fifa soccer 09, the top-selling soccer franchise from ea sports™ is surpassed with fifa soccer 10. responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, fifa soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
an advanced fifa soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled manager mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. these enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as fifa soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa soccer 10.
 
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa soccer 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
a deeper iteration of the ever-popular manager mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
new game modes, and innovations to popular features like be a pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

World Cup 98,"just what the heck is going on with world cup 98? is it a new game? is it fifa 99? or is it just a rehash of the old version and an attempt to remind everyone, six months after fifa 98 came out, that ea splurged and bought the license to the actual tournament itself this year? one thing for sure, it has a lot fewer teams on the roster. thankfully it also has some new tactical elements and in-game management options that add a lot to the game's already awesome gameplay. but is it worth it? well, that's sort of a personal question.like fifa 98, world cup 98 is chock-full of moves. there's plenty for the novice to learn, including flick-passes, long volleys, and diving headers on goal. for the adept, there's an easy to use passback system, to make the most of those ample corners and get the opposition's defense sweating a little. football illuminati will find a fistful of special moves that are a cinch to pull off, and after an hour or so, you'll be bicycle-kicking like pele and performing a bizarre array of mc hammer-inspired footwork to mesmerize and confuse the opposition. the beauty of both fifa 98 and world cup 98 is that, despite the volume of control possibilities, you can still play a pretty competitive game without any of the fancy stuff. just run, pass, and shoot. and pick up the rest on your own time.world cup 98 has a wealth of new in-game management and strategic control options. before the game, you can set up three different custom formations (labeled igm 1, 2, and 3) that can be switched during play at the touch of a button, er... ok, three buttons. in addition, the new version offers plays you can run, including an offsides trap, to (guess what?) draw the enemy offsides, a through ball run, to set up breakaway passes, and more. these simple plays provide an easy and powerful means to control non-ballcarriers, allowing more advanced players to pick apart the opposition. it's funny how things like a play book are taken for granted with a football title, yet we're so refreshingly surprised when a rudimentary one shows up in a soccer game. all cynicism aside, it's a great addition to gameplay.while there are dozens of new real-time management options out on the pitch, there's really nothing new behind the scenes. granted, fifa 98's plethora of management features remain. you can still go berserk and set your team's strategy to its offensive maximum, and set each player's individual attacking bias and aggression level to full, and then watch the rabid zealots swarm around the ball like angry bees (and lose the game with one good enemy through-pass). you can still create a bizarre race of puffy-haired redhead clones, and you can make your front line supersonic at the expense of all ball-carrying skill by tweaking their stats. versatile, but nothing new.like its predecessor, world cup 98 has terrific ai, which means more than just the confidence that when you pass the ball blindly downfield, there'll be someone there to pick it up. the cpu defense is tough on hotdoggers. you won't get past the amateur difficulty setting by just holding down the sprint button and sending your center striker downfield on a solo mission. thankfully, a smart ai encourages you to find creative ways to move the ball around the field and exploit enemy weaknesses. the default settings for player aggression leave your cpu-controlled teammates a little lackluster, especially on defense. however, with a couple of tweaks in the team management screens, they'll start going for it. you'll also find that the ai takes team ratings very seriously, and switching teams feels like playing a different game entirely. after missing pass after pass with jamaica, it's refreshing to really kick some ass with italy. that said, the ai feels essentially the same this time around.graphically, both the original fifa 98 and this version are loaded with amazingly lifelike polygonal animations of dozens of moves. there is no denying the realism of the short flick-pass or the sheer joy of sadistically slide-tackling the enemy goalie after he denies you your glory. red card, shmed card, it's just so darn fun, and it looks so good you won't be able to resist. ea promised that the new version would offer a significantly higher frame rate and smoother screen scrolling, but if anything, world cup 98 feels choppier than its predecessor. the frame rate seems lower and the anti-aliasing is less smooth on the players. although, the entire screen seems a little less foggy, and more in focus, so perhaps they've just removed a layer of the n64's patented soft-focus visual trickery. the most noticeable visual improvements seem to have occurred in miscellaneous graphical trivia. the jerseys look better. the various option screens have all been given a face-lift. plus, post-goal grandstanding (and reciprocal goalie pouting) has been expanded to include a number of new animations. some of these goalies get pissed. unfortunately, product placement has gone from cute (fuji ads on the sidelines) to irritating (the score is now brought to you by snickers - right on the score panel - every time). argh.fantastic commentary and an unlockable set of eight historically brilliant world cup-winning teams from the past round out the game. is it worth it? well, downsizing from nearly 200 teams to only 48 is pretty drastic, but only the die-hard real-life soccer enthusiast would probably even care. most of us are content to duke it out with italy or brazil and probably won't miss antigua. however, it somehow irks me that the perfectly rendered stadiums are all in france. yeah, yeah, i know. that's where the world cup is happening this year - france. francophile or not, die-hard soccer fanatics will find that the added tactical possibilities of world cup 98 are worth the ticket price. the rest of us may want to just wait for the next fifa game.

NBA Hangtime,"nba hangtime, a fast-paced arcade-style 2-on-2 basketball game, is the direct sequel to nba jam/nba jam tournament edition.nba jam series historynba jam was created in 1993 as an arcade game by a team at midway led by mark turmell (smash tv, nfl blitz, nba ballers) and including more famous mortal kombat co-creator ed boon among others.  the game was a hit in the arcade and spawned the updated nba jam tournament edition and then nba hangtime and nba maximum hangtime. on the home front, acclaim was responsible for bringing midway's arcade hits to consoles and, given nba jam was the top-grossing arcade game ever to that point in time, quickly produced home versions for the snes and sega genesis, which both sold very well, as well as for myriad other systems, and then released nba jam tournament edition to line their pockets even further.by this point in time, midway, seeing they were getting the short end of the stick with acclaim making tons of money off their popular games (besides nba jam, acclaim also made home versions of the popular mortal kombat series) terminated their agreement with acclaim with the intent of publishing future home versions of their arcade games.  however, acclaim responded with an end run around midway, securing the rights to the nba jam name directly from the nba.  this resulted in the series being bastardized in games like nba jam extreme, which was made solely by acclaim.midway, however, sucked it up, changed the name to nba hangtime, and continued.  they ported the arcade version to snes, genesis, playstation, n64 and other machines.gameplaynba hangtime at its heart is no-holds-barred, few rules followed arcade basketball 2-on-2 crazyness.  it can be played by up to 4 players, with each player controlling one real-life nba player with varying statistics.  if less than 4 players are available, the computer takes control of the rest of the players.the controls consist of three buttons and a joystick.  the stick is used for moving.  the buttons are shoot/jump, pass/steal and turbo.  the shoot button lets you shoot (duh), jump up for rebounds, and jump to block opposing shots when on defense.  the pass button lets you pass (duh) and steal when on defense.  turbo is used by itself to let you run faster, or in combination with the other buttons to either jump higher/quicker or to shove opposing players, often causing them to lose the ball.you can also tap turbo twice to do a spin move, making you very difficult to shove during the move.  there are other moves like alley-oops, hook shots, fadeaways, lean-in shots, throwing elbows, double dunks, super dunks and more that you can perform with well-timed button presses.other features include a player-creation mode (including choosing your own nickname on the court), record-keeping of your characters and the ability for them to improve stats, a trivia quiz at the end of the game, tons of secret codes for special characters/play modes, and a leaderboard.  each nba team has five players that you can team up in any way except two of the same.

the authority in wwe video games returns with wwe 2k16!
the newest addition to the flagship wwe franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new wwe superstars, divas and legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
features 
•largest roster ever: offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover superstar stone cold steve austin alongside seth rollins, daniel bryan, dean ambrose, bad news barrett, paige and finn bálor, wwe 2k16 includes the largest roster in wwe games history
-the roster contains an unprecedented combination of current wwe superstars and divas, emerging nxt talent, wwe hall of famers and wwe alumni from multiple eras
•arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator: fans who pre-order wwe 2k16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator:
-t-800 from the terminator and t-800 from terminator 2: judgment day
•2k showcase: the franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in wwe 2k16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in wwe history. along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•mycareer: the franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from nxt to wwe to earn a spot in the wwe hall of fame. in addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•creation suite: building on last year’s foundation, wwe 2k16’s creation suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including create a diva, create a championship, create an arena, and create a show. key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including create a superstar, create an entrance, superstar studio and community creations.
•wwe universe: wwe 2k16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. in addition, for the first time, superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•online: completely overhauled based on fan feedback, wwe 2k16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the wwe games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•soundtrack: players can customize their in-game music through the addition of superstar entrance music to the wwe 2k16 jukebox. additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•gameplay improvements: wwe 2k16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest wwe gameplay experience to date:
-improved controls: the controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. this change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. wwe 2k16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-new reversal system: the reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  each superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces major and minor reversals for select moves. minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. successful major reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-new pin system: the new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. if the opponent kicks out, a superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. there is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. rope breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. in line with wwe live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-chain wrestling: new positions and attributes allow players to distinguish superstars from one other. there can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-working holds: working holds are new for wwe 2k16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. just like on wwe programming, working holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-improved ai: wwe 2k16 sees big improvements to the ai for superstars, referees and managers. for example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. in addition, significant changes are included for match-specific ai, including tag team matches.
-more match types: many match types of been added for wwe 2k16, including ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-dynamic entrances: with the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. why wait for the bell? in wwe 2k16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•additional improvements: wwe 2k16 also includes an improved submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•overall enhancements: wwe 2k16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-new commentary team: for the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with john “bradshaw” layfield, new to wwe 2k16 joining returning commentators michael cole and jerry “the king” lawler. thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-visual upgrades: this year’s title features several thousand new animations. wwe superstar and diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-broadcast presentation: gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

WWE 2K16,"
the authority in wwe video games returns with wwe 2k16!
the newest addition to the flagship wwe franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new wwe superstars, divas and legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
features 
•largest roster ever: offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover superstar stone cold steve austin alongside seth rollins, daniel bryan, dean ambrose, bad news barrett, paige and finn bálor, wwe 2k16 includes the largest roster in wwe games history
-the roster contains an unprecedented combination of current wwe superstars and divas, emerging nxt talent, wwe hall of famers and wwe alumni from multiple eras
•arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator: fans who pre-order wwe 2k16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator:
-t-800 from the terminator and t-800 from terminator 2: judgment day
•2k showcase: the franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in wwe 2k16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in wwe history. along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•mycareer: the franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from nxt to wwe to earn a spot in the wwe hall of fame. in addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•creation suite: building on last year’s foundation, wwe 2k16’s creation suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including create a diva, create a championship, create an arena, and create a show. key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including create a superstar, create an entrance, superstar studio and community creations.
•wwe universe: wwe 2k16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. in addition, for the first time, superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•online: completely overhauled based on fan feedback, wwe 2k16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the wwe games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•soundtrack: players can customize their in-game music through the addition of superstar entrance music to the wwe 2k16 jukebox. additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•gameplay improvements: wwe 2k16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest wwe gameplay experience to date:
-improved controls: the controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. this change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. wwe 2k16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-new reversal system: the reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  each superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces major and minor reversals for select moves. minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. successful major reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-new pin system: the new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. if the opponent kicks out, a superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. there is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. rope breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. in line with wwe live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-chain wrestling: new positions and attributes allow players to distinguish superstars from one other. there can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-working holds: working holds are new for wwe 2k16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. just like on wwe programming, working holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-improved ai: wwe 2k16 sees big improvements to the ai for superstars, referees and managers. for example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. in addition, significant changes are included for match-specific ai, including tag team matches.
-more match types: many match types of been added for wwe 2k16, including ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-dynamic entrances: with the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. why wait for the bell? in wwe 2k16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•additional improvements: wwe 2k16 also includes an improved submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•overall enhancements: wwe 2k16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-new commentary team: for the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with john “bradshaw” layfield, new to wwe 2k16 joining returning commentators michael cole and jerry “the king” lawler. thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-visual upgrades: this year’s title features several thousand new animations. wwe superstar and diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-broadcast presentation: gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

WWE 2K16," 
the authority in wwe video games returns with wwe 2k16!
the newest addition to the flagship wwe franchise will deliver authentic, high-powered and hard-hitting action, including fan-favorite features and new wwe superstars, divas and legends, gameplay innovations, presentation updates and more.
features 
•largest roster ever: offering more than 120 unique playable characters, including cover superstar stone cold steve austin alongside seth rollins, daniel bryan, dean ambrose, bad news barrett, paige and finn bálor, wwe 2k16 includes the largest roster in wwe games history
-the roster contains an unprecedented combination of current wwe superstars and divas, emerging nxt talent, wwe hall of famers and wwe alumni from multiple eras
•arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator: fans who pre-order wwe 2k16 at any participating retailer will receive two exclusive playable versions of arnold schwarzenegger as the terminator:
-t-800 from the terminator and t-800 from terminator 2: judgment day
•2k showcase: the franchise’s popular story-based mode returns in wwe 2k16, enabling players to relive iconic matches and moments in wwe history. along the way, they will complete objectives to unlock legendary characters, entrance and ring gear, match types and unlockables. 
•mycareer: the franchise’s career-driven mode, now in its second year, will see players define their legacies by making critical choices while rising through the ranks from nxt to wwe to earn a spot in the wwe hall of fame. in addition, they will train, compete against others, conduct personality-driven interviews, interfere with rivals and/or form the ultimate tag team.
•creation suite: building on last year’s foundation, wwe 2k16’s creation suite deepens the player’s arsenal with new feature options, including create a diva, create a championship, create an arena, and create a show. key improvements have also been made to existing fan-favorite offerings, including create a superstar, create an entrance, superstar studio and community creations.
•wwe universe: wwe 2k16 makes core improvements to stories, rivals and match card selections. in addition, for the first time, superstars can be assigned to multiple shows, enabling players to have a broader experience.
•online: completely overhauled based on fan feedback, wwe 2k16 will provide users with multiple ways to play online with the wwe games community, including an improved matchmaking system
•soundtrack: players can customize their in-game music through the addition of superstar entrance music to the wwe 2k16 jukebox. additional in-game music will be announced later this year.
•gameplay improvements: wwe 2k16 will build upon last year’s foundation, including key enhancements and innovations based on critical and consumer feedback,  to deliver the strongest wwe gameplay experience to date:
-improved controls: the controls and move library were overhauled to cleanly separate strikes from grapples. this change provides players with more control over the exact type of attacks they want to initiate in every situation. wwe 2k16 also includes new attack positions, such as seated, to increase options for how players attack while experiencing greatly improved attacks outside the ring near barricades. opponents will now react more accurately to their environment.
-new reversal system: the reversal system has been reworked to improve the overall flow of the match and also create a new level of strategy during the matches.  each superstar has a limited number of reversals he or she can perform that recharge over time, meaning players might not want to simply try and reverse every attack. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces major and minor reversals for select moves. minor reversals are easier to perform and only require a single reversal stock. major reversals are more challenging to perform; however, they yield a much greater reward than damage. successful major reversals weaken the opponent in various ways and provide a new way to swing the momentum of the match in one’s favor.
-new pin system: the new pin system starts with an entirely new pin mini-game and offers a variety of new pin variations and reactions. if the opponent kicks out, a superstar may react to the near pin fall and gesture to the referee in frustration. in addition, wwe 2k16 introduces dirty pins and rope breaks. dirty pins allow players to use the ropes to their advantage to try and pin their opponents. there is a chance the referee may see this and call off the pin attempt. rope breaks are another way to get out of pin attempt but rely on the referee seeing the player grab the ropes. in line with wwe live events and programming, there is no guarantee what the referee is going to see during a match.
-chain wrestling: new positions and attributes allow players to distinguish superstars from one other. there can also be ties during a lockup; during the tie, there can be a clean break from the tie-up or a cheap shot from either the player or the opponent.
-working holds: working holds are new for wwe 2k16 and provide players with a way to regain stamina while depleting their opponents’ stamina. just like on wwe programming, working holds provide a way to collect one’s self in the middle or late part of a match and prepare for the next plan of attack.
-improved ai: wwe 2k16 sees big improvements to the ai for superstars, referees and managers. for example, managers can now engage during matches by either trying to distract the referee or get his attention to help out in the match. in addition, significant changes are included for match-specific ai, including tag team matches.
-more match types: many match types of been added for wwe 2k16, including ladder, handicap and tornado tag matches.
-dynamic entrances: with the improved presentation flow for matches, players are now able to take control of their superstars during the entrances and have the option to attack their opponents before the match even starts. why wait for the bell? in wwe 2k16, players can decide when they are ready for action.
•additional improvements: wwe 2k16 also includes an improved submission system and a vast number of new moves to create an even more engaging gameplay experience.
•overall enhancements: wwe 2k16 improves upon authenticity across the board, including:
-new commentary team: for the first time, a three-man team is now a part of the franchise, with john “bradshaw” layfield, new to wwe 2k16 joining returning commentators michael cole and jerry “the king” lawler. thousands of new lines were recorded, primarily in side by side studio sessions, ensuring authentic interactions among the trio.
-visual upgrades: this year’s title features several thousand new animations. wwe superstar and diva appearance are also been updated, including implementation of a full cloth physics system, enabling attire to appear and respond as realistically as possible. improved crowd variety, as well as more realistic sweat, better hair and hair physics round out the visual enhancements.
-broadcast presentation: gone are loading screens between entrances and the start of matches; instead, the camera pans the arena and over to the commentary team for thoughts on the upcoming match. significant improvements were also made to overall match presentation and flow, including new crowd members.

Pro Evolution Soccer 2016,"from its humble origins on psone, the pes series has leaped from  format to format, adding ever more realism as it evolved. this heritage  has been celebrated in pes 2016’s new tagline ‘love the past, play the future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core pes values in last  year’s pes 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
pes 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘best  sports game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘the beautiful game’. the series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present pes 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘the pitch is ours’ mantra. from  further integration of the industry leading fox engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of master league, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
fresh gameplay – exciting advancements reaffirming the pes series as having the no.1 gameplay.

advanced collision system – the physicality of the modern game has been realised in pes 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
aerial strength – with the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 control – in pes 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. the 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
perfect defence – performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. the ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
intelligent player ai – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
goal keeper id – in a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in catching, clearance, collapsing and  deflecting. this adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
celebration control – new for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

fundamental changes – new significant improvements across key modes and features.

new master league – the famous and hugely popular  master league sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, pes 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
new visuals – incorporating the many advancements  of the fox engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. see the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. new night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
dynamic weather – for the first time in the pes  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. the  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. this feature is applied to all offline modes  including the master league, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
human motion – seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. the new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
new ball physics – the past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for pes 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

quality improvements – many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myclub – since the launch of the mode in pes  2015, myclub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for pes 2016.  the enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. use gp acquired through matches or myclub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. build your  team, create your legacy!
dynamic wide camera angle – the new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to intelligent player ai. depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
commentary – new commentators have been  introduced for both uk and germany, with peter drury and marco hagemann  joining the pes team. an abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for master league, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
ps4 image importing – edit mode is synonymous  with the pes series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. ps4 (and ps3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

pes 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the uefa champions league club competition, which was announced  recently. this new 3 year partnership allows konami to feature both the  uefa champions league and uefa europa league club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the uefa super cup  featured within the iconic master league mode.

NFL Head Coach,"
the nfl head coach is the guy on the sidelines. sometimes you see him hurl his headset to the ground in frustration. sometimes he's pumping his fist in the air in triumph. sometimes you see him screaming at a player, white-knuckled fist wrapped around the face guard, steam billowing out of his mouth in the frigid weather. even when the teams win, he's never the mvp, and a player usually takes the credit at the press conference. who hasn't wanted to be a football coach?
head coach lets you step into the shoes of all those famous football geniuses who have gone before. manage a draft, hire staff, call plays, make trades, in the end, it's all your responsibility. this time, when the guy on field fumbles the ball, you really can blame him. you weren't the guy running. you just told him what to do.
start from scratch and build a winning organization with talent, strategy and guile. oh, and money. you'll probably need some of that, too. build a reputation as a coach, and watch it fall and rise with your successes. sit behind the desk, admiring your trophy case. stand on the sideline, sweating bullets in sudden-death. beat your players into shape. it's your job. you're an nfl head coach.
 

 

build a team: through drafts, free agency and trades, pick and choose your favorite players. play to your strengths or eliminate your weaknesses by recruiting that one perfect player to bring everything together. get them young and train them how you want, or shop around for the one skill your missing.
supervise a staff: recruit and hire a full staff of assistants, coordinators and coaches. they might make you look good, but if they screw up, it's all gonna be your fault. so choose carefully.
call the shots: build a playbook by creating new plays or adapting classics to your own style. drill them into your players and roll them out in front of the competition. go through every day of training camp drills, pre-season bumps, grueling practices, and triumphant games. this team looks to you to make every single call, and you'd better get it right.

Pro Evolution Soccer 2016,"from its humble origins on psone, the pes series has leaped from  format to format, adding ever more realism as it evolved. this heritage  has been celebrated in pes 2016’s new tagline ‘love the past, play the future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core pes values in last  year’s pes 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
pes 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘best  sports game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘the beautiful game’. the series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present pes 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘the pitch is ours’ mantra. from  further integration of the industry leading fox engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of master league, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
fresh gameplay – exciting advancements reaffirming the pes series as having the no.1 gameplay.

advanced collision system – the physicality of the modern game has been realised in pes 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
aerial strength – with the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 control – in pes 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. the 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
perfect defence – performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. the ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
intelligent player ai – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
goal keeper id – in a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in catching, clearance, collapsing and  deflecting. this adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
celebration control – new for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

fundamental changes – new significant improvements across key modes and features.

new master league – the famous and hugely popular  master league sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, pes 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
new visuals – incorporating the many advancements  of the fox engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. see the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. new night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
dynamic weather – for the first time in the pes  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. the  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. this feature is applied to all offline modes  including the master league, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
human motion – seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. the new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
new ball physics – the past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for pes 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

quality improvements – many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myclub – since the launch of the mode in pes  2015, myclub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for pes 2016.  the enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. use gp acquired through matches or myclub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. build your  team, create your legacy!
dynamic wide camera angle – the new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to intelligent player ai. depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
commentary – new commentators have been  introduced for both uk and germany, with peter drury and marco hagemann  joining the pes team. an abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for master league, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
ps4 image importing – edit mode is synonymous  with the pes series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. ps4 (and ps3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

pes 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the uefa champions league club competition, which was announced  recently. this new 3 year partnership allows konami to feature both the  uefa champions league and uefa europa league club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the uefa super cup  featured within the iconic master league mode.

FIFA Soccer 10,"on the heels of winning 25 international gaming awards with fifa soccer 09, the top-selling soccer franchise from ea sports™ is surpassed with fifa soccer 10. responding to consumer feedback from more than 275 million online games played, fifa soccer 10 refines an already potent game engine, focusing on what matter most to fans.
 
an advanced fifa soccer 10 features core gameplay refinements based on responsiveness and intelligence, plus a completely overhauled manager mode that includes more than 50 major improvements. these enhancements and more deliver a new standard for authenticity, as fifa soccer 10 continues to set the benchmark in both innovations and gameplay as the most complete simulation of soccer.
 
on the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that fifa soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction. on attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. on defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in fifa soccer 10.
 
three new innovations change the player control experience in fifa soccer 10. the first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. an innovative concept called freedom in physical play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
a deeper iteration of the ever-popular manager mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
new game modes, and innovations to popular features like be a pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

Pro Evolution Soccer 2016,"from its humble origins on psone, the pes series has leaped from  format to format, adding ever more realism as it evolved. this heritage  has been celebrated in pes 2016’s new tagline ‘love the past, play the future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core pes values in last  year’s pes 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
pes 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘best  sports game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘the beautiful game’. the series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present pes 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘the pitch is ours’ mantra. from  further integration of the industry leading fox engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of master league, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
fresh gameplay – exciting advancements reaffirming the pes series as having the no.1 gameplay.

advanced collision system – the physicality of the modern game has been realised in pes 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
aerial strength – with the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 control – in pes 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. the 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
perfect defence – performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. the ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
intelligent player ai – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
goal keeper id – in a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in catching, clearance, collapsing and  deflecting. this adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
celebration control – new for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

fundamental changes – new significant improvements across key modes and features.

new master league – the famous and hugely popular  master league sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, pes 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
new visuals – incorporating the many advancements  of the fox engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. see the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. new night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
dynamic weather – for the first time in the pes  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. the  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. this feature is applied to all offline modes  including the master league, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
human motion – seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. the new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
new ball physics – the past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for pes 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

quality improvements – many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myclub – since the launch of the mode in pes  2015, myclub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for pes 2016.  the enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. use gp acquired through matches or myclub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. build your  team, create your legacy!
dynamic wide camera angle – the new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to intelligent player ai. depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
commentary – new commentators have been  introduced for both uk and germany, with peter drury and marco hagemann  joining the pes team. an abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for master league, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
ps4 image importing – edit mode is synonymous  with the pes series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. ps4 (and ps3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

pes 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the uefa champions league club competition, which was announced  recently. this new 3 year partnership allows konami to feature both the  uefa champions league and uefa europa league club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the uefa super cup  featured within the iconic master league mode.

Winter Sports 3: The Great Tournament,"rtl sports launches a new season of winter sports: winter sports 2010 – the great tournament is being developed by the games provider 49games in hamburg, germany.
this year's edition of the winter sports simulation was completely reworked in order to use the next gen consoles' functions to their greatest advantage. apart from the attractive sports such as boardercross, ski flying, alpine skiing, freeride skiing, short-track speed skating, figure skating, bobsledding, and biathlon, players of winter sports 2010 also have a complex career mode to look forward to.
in the story-based career mode, players can invest any experience points they collect in improved skills and equipment for their characters, and work their way up from beginners to world-class athletes. all of this takes place within a gripping story in which the player takes part in 16 competitions against four national teams. as an added challenge, one of those teams is the player's ultimate rival, and particularly hard to beat.
winter sports 2010 also provides ""casual"" entertainment: in single discipline mode, players get to take part in the event of their choice in order to hone their skills in that discipline. veterans also get their money's worth in winter sports 2010. the extended trick system for the disciplines of boardercross and freeride skiing provides the ultimate challenge for experts.
winter sports 2010 will also thrill fans of multiplayer games. up to four friends may compete for the top position in the championship rankings - there can be only one champion, after all.
eight unique sports disciplines and full online support for all platforms for the first time ever, make for hours of gaming fun. the online mode ""fair play"" launches an event where each participant controls an equally skilled athlete, thus showing the players' real strengths and weaknesses in every discipline. on the other hand, the players' individually trained avatars get to compare their abilities in the online ""tough mode"".
features:
-       eight unique and distinct sports: boardercross, freeride skiing, alpine skiing, ski flying, short-track speed skating, biathlon, bobsledding, and figure skating
-       five game modes: career, cup, single course, campaign, multiplayer
-       four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, extreme
-       fair play strips help identify ""good"" and ""bad"" players in the career and online modes; the players' behavior is immediately reflected in the fair play strips
-       story-based career mode with role-playing elements, special skills, and upgrades
-       campaign with 44 gripping challenges
-       multiplayer: online and split-screen modes (up to 4 players)
-       online mode with a world-wide ranking system
-       extended trick system for boardercross and freeride skiing
-       appealing commentators create an authentic competitive atmosphere
-       next gen system of graphics and physics
