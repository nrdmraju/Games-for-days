Sonic & Knuckles,"the story picks up from the ending of sonic 3.  dr. robotnik's (dr. eggman) orbital weapon, the death egg, has been badly damaged in the climactic battle between himself and sonic the hedgehog. as the satellite falls back to floating island, landing in a volcanic crater, sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.
sonic knows there are many chaos emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful master emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. worried that robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired death egg, he sets off to try and destroy it once and for all, keeping an eye out for knuckles the echidna, still smarting from his launch base defeat.
meanwhile, as robotnik begins repairing the death egg, he decides that knuckles has served his purpose, and dispatches an eggrobo, a highly autonomous robot built in his own image, to dispose of knuckles. he assumes that if eggrobo can't destroy knuckles, his cover as the real mastermind won't be blown, leaving the possibility that sonic and knuckles may fight to the death. eggrobo's first assassination attempt - dropping a bomb on a half-asleep knuckles - only serves to enrage the echidna, setting him on a mission to stop both sonic, and his mystery assailant.

Sonic Colors,"sonic colors is a high speed action-adventure in which sonic races through theme park-inspired worlds to rescue a colorful alien race from the clutches of dr. eggman. 

an extraordinary amusement park has been seen orbiting around the home planet of sonic the hedgehog, and rumors are spreading that an alien race of wisps, who have a unique colorful energy, are being held captive there by the evil dr. eggman.  soon after arriving at the amusement park, sonic discovers he is able to use these mysterious alien forces to help the wisps escape.

the alien wisps featured in the game each have a unique color power that, once freed, sonic is able to absorb while speeding through the various theme park inspired planets.  the wisp energy enables sonic to create new paths through the stages by drilling through the ground (yellow drill) for example, or speeding through the stage as a laser (cyan laser). stringing the wisp power-ups together creates a combo that increases sonic’s boost gauge even more quickly.

Sonic Colors,"sonic colors is a high speed action-adventure in which sonic races through theme park-inspired worlds to rescue a colorful alien race from the clutches of dr. eggman. 

an extraordinary amusement park has been seen orbiting around the home planet of sonic the hedgehog, and rumors are spreading that an alien race of wisps, who have a unique colorful energy, are being held captive there by the evil dr. eggman.  soon after arriving at the amusement park, sonic discovers he is able to use these mysterious alien forces to help the wisps escape.

the alien wisps featured in the game each have a unique color power that, once freed, sonic is able to absorb while speeding through the various theme park inspired planets.  the wisp energy enables sonic to create new paths through the stages by drilling through the ground (yellow drill) for example, or speeding through the stage as a laser (cyan laser). stringing the wisp power-ups together creates a combo that increases sonic’s boost gauge even more quickly.

throughout your adventure, create your own abilities by building vehicles for banjo to pilot over land, water, and air. vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. use your imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle you choose. log's challenges have one goal, but your choice of vehicle and tactics will determine how you get there. by exploring worlds and solving puzzles, you will be rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in your quest to defeat grunty once and for all.

adventure and imagination: if you can imagine it, you can build it in the mumbo's motors easy-to-use workshop. then put your creation to the test as you take on grunty in your quest for spiral mountain. unlike other games, where you progressively pick up new skills or abilities at points pre-determined by the game’s creator, banjo-kazooie: nuts & bolts puts the power of improving banjo's abilities into your hands as you build vehicles that allow banjo to progress through the game. vehicle parts include a wide variety of body panels, engines, wheels, wings, propellers, fuel, and weapons, plus many more weird and wonderful gadgets such as floaters, mumbo bombos, and the versatile sticky ball, from which you can design and create anything from a simple object-carrying truck to a space-age flying saucer. once you've designed your creation, give it the finishing touch by painting it and choosing a suitable name before banjo jumps in and pilots it into action.
customizable experience: with more than 100 contraption parts and unlimited combinations possible, no two players will have the same experience in banjo-kazooie: nuts & bolts. by exploring the vast game worlds, discovering hidden secrets, and solving puzzles to win rewards, you will continually find more and more ways to customize and improve your contraptions, creating an unprecedented level of user-generated content for a 3-d platform adventure game.
fun right out of the box: don't worry if you aren’t the world’s greatest inventor or want to skip the workshop and get straight to the action, because banjo-kazooie: nuts & bolts comes with a fully loaded experience right out of the box. pre-built vehicles are included so you can jump right in and get started, with many more contraptions available for purchase throughout the adventure using the in-game currency system of musical notes.
engaging storyline and entertaining characters: two of rare's most beloved characters return from retirement, making their debut on xbox 360. to win the deed to their homeland and prevent the evil witch gruntilda from developing it into tower blocks and malls, banjo and his best friend kazooie battle over land, sea, and air against their longtime rival. familiar faces such as mumbo jumbo, bottles, captain blubber, and the jinjos are also back to lend a hand, along with an equally colorful cast of new friends and foes. look out for trophy thomas, piddles, lord of the games, and grunty's mechanically menacing army of gruntbots.
enjoy alone or with friends: banjo-kazooie: nuts and bolts offers complete single-player and multiplayer experiences. play through the adventure alone in the single-player campaign, or play with friends in competitive or cooperative challenges on your own or in teams.
fun for everyone: xbox 360 is the home to the best entertainment experiences for everyone. with banjo-kazooie: nuts & bolts, xbox 360 continues to build its impressive lineup of content that appeals to people of all ages and types.

once baby mario is securely hitched to yoshi’s back, yoshi runs through the side-scrolling levels, desperately trying to keep his passenger baby mario safe from harm. with gaping pits and cliffs to negotiate (and coins to snaffle for the high score), here you can draw clouds that will let yoshi climb across the terrain to avoid environmental hazards, as well as the army of bad guys who are intent on breaking up the party. you can also toss eggs at bad guys by tapping them with the stylus - or tap yoshi to make him leap from danger's path - and finally make it to the end of the level, baby and all.
these basic gameplay tenets recur across several different modes, with score attack, marathon, battle, and time attack all vying for your attention. a suitably hectic multiplayer game for two players is part of the fun too! yoshi came, he ‘saur and he conquered…

protect baby mario as he falls by drawing clouds on the touch screen and then blow into the ds microphone to delete them.

Voodoo Vince,"
voodoo vince™ is an outrageous venture—from the streets of new orleans to the depths of a louisiana bayou—where you explore and fight as a tattered-but-tough voodoo doll on a quest to find the whereabouts of your keeper, madam charmaine.
in true voodoo style, vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! by racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.
 
“an early nominee for best new character of 2003""—official xbox magazine  “voodoo vince is surely on his way to becoming a big, bright, shining star …over the years we’ve played a lot of characters that do a lot of things, but none quite as cool as voodoo vince.”—play magazine  “the most striking aspect of voodoo vince is its unique world. playful, with a touch of macabre, the game’s new orleans (or ‘nawlins’ as it’s properly pronounced) is oozing with personality.”—gamespy  ""stick a pin in me and call me vince, this type of voodoo certainly has all the right elements that make for a good time at the old bayou.""—eduardo zacarias, gamezone.com 




voodoo combat action: employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! unlike in other games, you actually use dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase ""no pain, no gain.""
magical voodoo world: thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic french quarter, and a network of boggy sewers.
vehicles and minigames: as the game unfolds, vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete the quest.
dynamic cast of characters: no adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. offbeat creatures with all the charm of new orleans are around every corner. vince encounters everything from ginger dead men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.
developer information: beep industries was founded in 2000 by creative director clayton kauzlaric, along with an impressive team of dedicated game industry veterans, including director of technology matt setzer, art director gary hanna, executive producer barbara hanna, lead programmer kurt pfeifer, systems architect brian w. brown and business manager harald kohl. the bulk of beep's staff have worked together for nearly a decade. based in kirkland, wash., the company was started with the goal of creating games and characters that fit the distinctive personality of its staff while maintaining uncompromising standards for art, technology and gameplay. beep industries' first title has been in production since october 2001.

Rocket: Robot on Wheels,"rocket: robot on wheels is a delightful platform game that on the surface resembles other pointless, cute, character-driven platform games. however, after spending some time with rocket, it reveals itself to be a deep, fun-filled adventure that really draws you in.rocket begins in a typically cute and fuzzy fashion at a futuristic theme park on the eve of its opening day. the man in charge of the operation leaves our hero, a robotic unicycle, to tend to the park while the man is at home. and yes, something terrible happens. the vindictive mascot of the park, jojo the raccoon, escapes from his cage and rewires the whole park. so it's up to you, as rocket the robot unicycle, to make things right again.once you start to play and get a feel for the control, the game seems straightforward. but rocket isn't your typical fast-paced platformer. each level contains sublevel upon sublevel, not to mention minigames, puzzles, and lots of little things to interact with and figure out. for instance, early in the game you find out that one of the roller coasters is missing several screws. once you chase down the screws within the level and bring them back to the attraction you must build a roller coaster that you'll actually get to ride. building the track in the proper way will let you grab more items and bonuses. this hands-on problem-solving technique is really what sets the game apart from other platformers. instead of just hitting button a to smash object b and collect item c, you must use your head along with a fair amount of control pad dexterity. the struggle and triumph of solving the problem is more of a reward than the actual object you are trying to collect.visually, rocket looks like a typical n64 platform game. the game has a very basic, colorful look. while rocket himself looks good, the cast of generic characters you come across in the game are a little on the simple side. the whole production moves along at a smooth pace with a healthy frame rate. of course, like most 3d platform games on the market, the camera isn't completely glitch-proof. there are occasions when the camera points directly at rocket's face, leaving you blind as to what awaits you. the aural portion of rocket is par for the n64 course. happy, lighthearted tunes permeate the entire game, and the sound effects are cartoony in nature. in the end, rocket is a good platform game that will please platform fans. its gameplay is diverse yet solid, and it all combines to form a game that will keep you interested for quite some time.

any mind, any time. for years, the psychonauts have deployed their psychically-armed operatives all over the world, but this time trouble is brewing right in their own backyard. someone is abducting students from the psychonaut boot camp-a deranged scientist who only wants their brains. one cadet-a mysterious and powerful new arrival named raz-stands alone against the lunatic. raz must develop and unleash an arsenal of paranormal powers and his most powerful weapon of all-the ability to launch himself telepathically into someone else's mind, and run around in the demented amusement park of their imagination. ultimately he must enter the mind of his worst enemy and destroy his dark plans at their source, while trying not to lose his sanity in the process.

embark on a third-person psychic odyssey through thirteen incredibly unique levels: three set in the real world, and ten set inside the mental worlds of misfits, monsters and madmen  
rise up in rank as you collect figments of other people's imaginations, sort their emotional baggage, clear out their mental cobwebs, and crack open their memory vaults  
complete special training missions to learn the power of levitation and the ability to focus raz' mental energy into a powerful psi-blast  
rank up to earn more psychic powers such as telekinesis (toss enemies or objects with your mind), invisibility (convince your foes they can't see you), pyrokinesis (set the world on fire), clairvoyance (see through the eyes of another), and confusion (cloud the minds of your enemies, play tricks on your friends)  
put your thoughts to use-raz can grab the thought bubble over his head and pull it down around himself as a shield, hang from it like a hot air balloon, or jump on top of it and ride it around like a skateboard.  
interact with a multitude of dynamic environmental features, such as tightropes, trapezes, ladders, poles, ledges, trampolines, climbing walls and rail slides.  
non-linear gameplay with incredible depth offers players multiple paths and sub-challenges (digging up psitanium arrowheads, finding lost brains, telekinetic canoeing, and winning the psychic scavenger hunt) so there is always a goal to accomplish  
immersive story injected with lots of humor features vivid characters and a range of unique and wildly imaginative environments  
challenging puzzles span a range of difficulty, with alternate solutions that self-tailor themselves to the player's own strengths and abilities
