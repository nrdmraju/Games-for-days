Grand Theft Auto III,"emerging from the underworld, grand theft auto 3 dares to set new levels of unflinching criminal behavior in a dark, ruthless videogame that never pretends to be anything but truly adult entertainment. make no mistake -- videogames have grown up, and gta3 demonstrates that fully. not only is the content severely mature -- how could a game putting you in the shoes of a mob gun-for-hire who has no qualms against hit orders, car jackings, or public use of heavy artillery not earn that ""m"" rating? -- but the game itself shows incredible leaps in production values to achieve that gritty reality. hollywood talents such as michael rapaport, and michael madson give voice to the gangland thugs and mafioso, while the playstation 2 super-charges gta3's massive scale of crowded streets crammed with cars to steal. liberty city is wide open to those who control it, and you're the kind of guy who makes his own key. in all seriousness, this game is rated ""mature"" for a reason -- it's not for those under 17. otherwise, they don't get much hotter than grand theft auto 3 ... if they know what's good for them.

God of War III,"
god of war® 3 finds kratos raining carnage and destruction upon the gods who have betrayed him and the entire ancient greek world. armed with his deadly double-chained blades, kratos will take on mythology’s darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles on his merciless quest to destroy olympus and the mighty zeus himself.
 
key features
god of war iii is the epic conclusion to the greek mythological trilogy which will complete kratos’ story that began in the original title for the playstation®2.
true to the series roots, the four pillars of gameplay - brutal combat, intricate puzzles, exploration of awe-inspiring worlds, and a compelling story – all return to make god of war iii the ultimate experience.
god of war iii picks up exactly where the action of god of war ii left off – kratos must take his quest for vengeance to the very stronghold of the zeus. as the army of olympus surges out to meet him in battle and the chaos of the great war is reignited, kratos must scale the summit of mount olympus on the back of the mighty titan gaia, leading his new colossal allies in an all out assault on the olympians.
the menacing creatures of greek mythology in god of war iii are not only targets of kratos’ brutal destruction, but can now be manipulated against their will, as he uses them to cross chasms, inflict blind rage against enemies, reveal puzzles and secrets, and as tools of complete annihilation as he makes his way on a quest fueled by hate and vengeance.
as kratos continues on his path of revenge, he will uncover new deadly weapons like the cestus, powerful metal gauntlets with devastating strength, and other brutal instruments of war that will allow him to learn ruthless new techniques such as grappling with enemies and launching explosive wall to ground attacks.
built from the ground up, the brand new engine that powers god of war iii was designed for one main purpose – to achieve a level of scale never thought possible. kratos can now carve through armies of enemies while navigating on the back of a ‘living level’ – a massive, moving, breathing titan as tall as the empire state building.
the ps3 capabilities have allowed the developers to bring the world of god of war to life like never before. battling in detailed and unique 3d worlds lit by hundreds of dynamic lights and featuring textures with quadruple the resolution, kratos and his enemies now feature realistic muscle striations, detailed facial expressions, and new heightened levels of brutality and gore.

Assassin's Creed,"assassin's creed is a video game developed by ubisoft montreal and published by ubisoft. it was released worldwide in november 2007. on september 22, 2007, ubisoft announced the pc version has been delayed until early 2008. the player assumes the role of desmond miles, a seemingly normal bartender who is also the most modern member of a long family tree of assassins. he is taken to a facility where he uses the animus, a machine that allows him to see the memories of his ancestors during the third crusade, in the year 1191. desmond assumes the role of altaïr (الطائر, arabic, ""the flying one""), a member of the hashshashin sect (the original ""assassins""), whose objective is to slay the nine historical figures who are propagating the crusades. as the player finds and kills these targets, their conspiracy is unveiled. the player is able to travel through three cities: jerusalem, acre and damascus as well as masyaf, the assassins' stronghold. the interactive environments of the cities are populated by many people, and the way the player controls altaïr affects how the bystanders around him react to his presence. for example, when going through a crowd, if the player lightly moves someone out of the way, it will not have a significant effect. however, if the player throws someone to the ground and hurts or kills them, the crowd may unite against him, which will also attract guards and he will then have to find a way out or hide. similarly, if the player shoves a person aside, they may shove him back. if he climbs walls, civilians will gather around, attracting unwanted attention from guards. the producers claim the environment is historically accurate. the locations in the game are distinctive models of the cities. all of altaïr's targets are also historic figures who died or disappeared in the year 1191, although not necessarily by assassination.

Resident Evil 4,"the 4th entry in the main line of resident evil games (discounting the spinoffs and side games) revolutionizes the series entirely. the game takes on a much more action/shooter aspect as it leaves behind most of the jump from your seat moments for fast paced, adrenaline rush and challenging set combat situations.
although different from the previous games in the series, this doesn't mean it is non sensically different as the story, feel and characters of the game are definitely in line with previous res.
it's a 3rd person shooter with some timed events and melee combat added to it. the game really shows off on the graphical side. definitely a challenging game that rewards precision and experience. some of the best boss fights in any action game are to be encountered with everything from quick time events to trying to survive against capable and impressive bosses.
the story revolves around leon kennedy from re 2 investigating the disappearence of the daughter of the president of the united states in rural spain. eventually, you discover that there are very bad things going on in the town and around it as you encounter both paranormal and downright weird enemies trying to end your game.
definitely one of the most fun and best games of the last generation. it runs for about 12-16 hours in the main story.
in addition to everything in the original gamecube version, the ps2 version includes additional modes of play such as playing as ada wong in separate ways which is her perspective of the events in the game only in summarized form compared to the main story (shorter game, about 5 hours). there is also the assignment ada mission to play around with. so it's definitely worth picking this version up if you haven't played the original (or even if you have really).

Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,"the star wars saga continues in star wars: the force unleashed, a video game developed by lucasarts, which casts players as darth vader's ""secret apprentice"" and promises to unveil new revelations about the star wars galaxy. the expansive story is set during the largely unexplored era between star wars: episode ii revenge of the sith and star wars: episode iv a new hope. in it, players will assist the iconic villain in his quest to rid the universe of jedi - and face decisions that could change the course of their destiny.
as its name implies, the force unleashed completely re-imagines the scope and scale of the force by taking full advantage of newly developed technologies that will be seen and experienced for the first time: digital molecular matter (dmm), by pixelux entertainment, and euphoria by naturalmotion ltd. paired with the powerful havok physics system, these new technologies create gameplay only possible on the new generation of consoles. dmm incorporates the physical properties of anything in the environment so that everything reacts exactly like it should - wood breaks like wood, glass shatters like glass, plants on the planet felucia bend like plants on the planet felucia would, and more. meanwhile, as a revolutionary behavioral-simulation engine, euphoria enables interactive characters to move, act and even think like actual human beings, adapting their behavior on the fly and resulting in a different payoff every single time.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow,"
in tom clancy’s splinter cell®: pandora tomorrow™, you play sam fisher, a cold-blooded stealth soldier waging a one-man war against an indonesian terrorist network.




believe the story: inspired by the world of tom clancy, pandora tomorrow features a story line so real you can feel it. tension-filled stealth action springs from a compelling and original plot that’s so realistic it could’ve been ripped from the headlines by scriptwriter jt petty, who penned the original tom clancy’s splinter cell.
understand the characters: in this sequel, favorite characters like sam fisher and irving lambert return, unveiling even more about their personal histories in this character-driven story line. the cast of new antagonists includes the highly dangerous suhadi sodano, an indonesian guerilla leader whose beliefs are sound, but whose methods are barbaric. and, then, there is norman soth, a cia-trained mercenary. is he deep under cover or a traitor working for the enemy? you’ll also encounter douglas shetland, the director of a private military corporation and an old acquaintance of sam. and, there’s so much more to discover …
immerse yourself: revolutionary lighting, shadowing, animation, physics, and sound effects are pushed to the limit to create a universe so tightly woven that the line between reality and gaming starts to blur. high-resolution cinematics, amazing sound design, and top-quality voice-overs give pandora tomorrow a unique movie-production quality.
show off your moves: now, more than ever, sam relies on his moves. in this sequel to the original splinter cell, circumstances demand that sam use his agility and athleticism to avoid detection and death. in fact, the level design demands them. use a half-split jump to reach a ledge. zip line across an open courtyard. grapple along the side of a building, and swat-turn to bypass open doors unseen.
strap on the gear: based on prototypes currently in development and gadgets out on the field, sam fisher’s high tech gadgets and tools will have you well-prepared for some intense stealth action.
challenge your friends: enjoy evolutionary multiplayer gameplay online.

Castlevania: Lament of Innocence,"my personal opinion is that this was the first ""good"" 3-d castlevania game many do not agree that there is a ""good"" one yet. this game is the first, chronologically, in the castlevania series. it reveals very important elements to the story of the belmonts such as the birth of dracula, the first belmont to encounter him, their relationship before becoming enemies, and the creation of the vampire killer (a very sad story). i found the music in this game to be remarkable. brought me back to the old castlevania days when music helped create atmoshpere. the level designed might not be original but they are very challanging and well designed. the game is quite long itself but also has quite a few side quests to keep you playing beyond the ending. the voice acting and dialogue can often be disapointing. no more than most american voice acting in video games but still hampers the amazing story that is being told. this game has one of the biggest plot twists i've ever encountered while gaming and makes the famous vampire killer (the whip the belmonts are known for) all the more intense.

Dante's Inferno,"
an abducted soul, a lifetime of sins, a journey to the depths of despair. dante’s inferno™ is a third-person action adventure adaptation of the medieval epic poem the divine comedy by dante alighieri. the dark fiction gave birth to the tuscan italian dialect and is widely considered to have defined the western world’s contemporary conception of hell and purgatory. the poem tells the tale of dante who journeys through the twisted, menacing nine circles of hell in pursuit of his beloved beatrice.
written in the 14th century, the divine comedy was published and read aloud in italian (unlike the bible), thereby making the poem accessible to the mass public. the poem delivers a striking and allegorical vision of the christian afterlife and the punishments of hell. in part one, known as dante’s inferno, dante traverses all nine circles of hell; limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery.

MadWorld,"in this age of 1080p resolution, to best stress the idea of “blood” was to immerse users in a game wrapped in black and white.
madworld revolves around the themes of brutality and exhilaration. to give madworld the graphical edge to match its brutal theme, we tried removing all color from the world except for blood. as a result, we decided the best way to convey blood, and thus brutality, was against this black and white backdrop. knowing that there are no other action games with this sort of avant-garde graphical style, our course was set.
by adding touches from american comics, like the exclamations that appear during action scenes, anyone who knows how it feels to read a comic book (or watch an episode of tom & jerry) should instantly be able to enjoy playing madworld. we are also taking the simple controls of the wii and adding a variety of actions to the gameplay mix.
often times, brutality is expressed in a spiteful nature. there are already plenty of games out there that hit this mark; however, we decided that madworld’s brutality should be aimed at providing the user with a sense of exhilaration during play.  to give you an example from gameplay, we have a scene where you can pull a street sign from the ground and shove it into a enemy’s head. however, i thought that it is much more fun to stab someone with a sign that actually has some sort of meaning as opposed to a knife. we tried the idea out, and the reaction amongst the team was so positive, i knew this was the way to proceed.  while one type of action is already fun, one of madworld’s most innovative points is the ability to link and layer these actions together. for instance, you can grab that enemy with the street sign through his head and throw him against a spiked wall.

Hitman,"
become the master assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. as  agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in  exotic locations around the world. gameplay focuses on taking out  targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of  approach. where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to  you.
hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. the  experience began with a prologue and paris location in march, continued  with episode 2: sapienza in april, episode 3: marrakesh in may, the  summer bonus episode in july, episode 4: bangkok in august and episode  5: colorado in september. the season finale in hokkaido, japan arrived  on october 31st.
hitman also features a major live component, which is made up of  elusive targets, escalation contracts, community-inspired challenge  packs and contracts mode.
an elusive target is the closest thing to the hitman fantasy that  we’ve ever created. these targets will be custom-created characters that  are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time  in real-time. you’ll only have one chance to take them down. if they  escape, they are gone for good. if you kill them, that’s the way that  you killed them. there are no do-overs and no second chances. when an  elusive target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never  return.
escalation mode is something else completely new for hitman and was  created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players.  you’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to  complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements.  this mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and  mixing them up. it’s more about being playful than realistic.
contracts mode returns from hitman absolution; play-to-create, mark  your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your  friends. we will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the  featured contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever  you load up the game.

Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate,"continuing the celebration started by monster hunter generations on nintendo 3ds, we’ve expanded the monster roster, the number of ways  you can hunt, and cranked up the challenge with “g rank” quests. if you  played the original game, good news is you’ll be able to transfer your  save data and jump straight into all the new content on nintendo switch!
monstrous roster
featuring a diverse cast of returning fan favorites, new variant  “deviant” monsters, an all-new elder dragon valstrax and a new endgame  boss ahtal-ka, you’ll have your hands full with unique quest targets and  gear to craft from them. for those of you that will be newly jumping  in, deviant monsters are even more powerful variants of enemies you will  soon become familiar with, monsters that have survived previous hunter  encounters and have taken on new traits and abilities.
hunt your way
also building on mhgen’s hunting style system, we are introducing two brand new styles:

alchemy style offers a twist to the average hunting arsenal by giving  a barrel that, when shaken a bit, can yield items with special  properties, interesting buffs for your hunting party, or even unique  attacks. pair this style with the hunting horn and sword & shield to  become to the ultimate support hunter!
valor style demands the ultimate knowledge of your target as you place a  bet on your health bar in exchange for powerful counter attacks. this  one is for the folks out there who like to live on the edge or are  looking to master flawless hunting methods.

all the gear, these two new styles, along with the existing four  (guild, striker, adept and aerial) and new hunter arts (super moves!)  add up to a near limitless amount of possibilities for you to  experiment, changing up your experience every time or customizing your  hunter to find a hunting type that feels personalized just for you.
puttin’ the g in challenge
so with all these possibilities, you’ll of course want to put your  build, as well as your skillset to the test. or maybe you want to try  out how versatile you can actually be. enter g rank. the toughest  monsters await you, with new attacks and new behaviors. and, of course,  the best gear is locked behind felling these beasts. so make sure to  team up with up to 3 other hunters (local or online multiplayer) and  coordinate your styles and hunter arts to come out victorious.

Action Force,"this game was virtually the same as another atari 2600 release, g.i. joe: cobra strike. atari changed the name of the game for release outside of the united states, due to the fact that the g.i. joe brand name was almost unknown outside of america, and didn't carry the same selling power for the cartridge.
the object of the game was quite simply.  at the top of the screen, there was a cobra who would shoot at the shield that protected the bootcamp.  the player's goal was to use two lazers (on opposite sides of the screen) to shoot the snake multiple times, killing it prior to the cobra destroying the shield, and thus leaving the camp unprotected.
it was very much like a lot of 2600 games at the time.  an object at the top of the screen shoots an object at the bottom, and the player is supposed to destroy that object first. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Metal Gear Solid HD Collection,"description
from the critically acclaimed director, hideo kojima, metal gear solid  hd collection offers a handful of the most popular metal gear solid  titles from   the past in true hd for the first time ever. featuring three complete  games, metal gear solid 2: sons of liberty, metal gear solid: snake  eater   and metal gear solid: peace walker, the hd collection offers old and  new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and  storytelling of the   mgs franchise.
the ""metal gear solid (mgs)"" series is the seminal work of hideo  kojima, japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth  action game   genre. the series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million  copies sold worldwide. the player controls a secret agent from an elite   special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through  enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of  battle.   alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will  find it tough to come out alive. but that is the secret behind the  series'   popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat,  and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.
the mgs series is also known for its storyline, which blends  seamlessly with the gameplay. the scenarios are based on extensive  research and   incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.
these elements have made mgs what it is today: a mature work of  entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video  games, and one   of the leading products of the japanese content business.



metal gear solid 2

after the shadow moses incident, technological data on the  nuclear-armed walking tank metal gear leaks onto the black market. solid  snake and his   allies form the anti-metal gear ngo ""philanthropy"" and set out in  pursuit of a tanker carrying a new metal gear prototype. but snake falls  into a   trap set by former foxhound member ocelot, and is believed lost along  with the tanker at the bottom of the hudson river. two years later, the  big shell, an oil   spill cleanup facility constructed on the bay, is taken over by  terrorists led by a man claiming to be the long-lost solid snake. the  government   sends raiden, a new recruit in the new foxhound, to infiltrate the big  shell and rescue the us president, who is held hostage inside... the  underlying theme of this         second entry in the series is ""memes,"" or cultural genes.


metal gear solid 3

the story shifts back in time to 1964, the height of the cold  war. naked snake-the man who would later become the legendary mercenary  known as big         boss-heads into soviet territory to help the scientist sokolov  defect to the west. but the mission ends in failure due to the betrayal  of snake's         mentor and mission advisor the boss, a female soldier known as  ""the mother of special forces."" the boss defects to the soviet union,  taking a miniature         nuclear warhead with her as a gift, which her new hosts promptly  launch at a russian research facility. naked snake heads once more into  the soviet         union on a mission to kill the boss... the third mgs game tells  the story of men and women who struggle to remain loyal even while their  fates are at         the mercy of the ever changing political ""scene.""


metal gear solid: peace walker

stories tell of a legendary solider who once waged war against  the world. his name was naked snake, a.k.a. big boss, and the truth  behind this         legend will finally be told. the era is the 1970's . big boss  had stationed his soldiers in colombia, south america, where he was         approached by visitors from costa rica, a ""nation without a  military."" in the shadow of the cuban missile crisis, as latin america  became a key         to maintaining the power balance between east and west, costa  rica had miraculously managed to maintain its peace and neutrality.  however, in         various regions of the country, a mysterious armed force seemed  to be engaging in suspicious activities. now, to preserve peace in this  nation         without a military, the soldiers move into action. in time, they  would be known as the founders of ""outer heaven.""

Hitman,"
become the master assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. as  agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in  exotic locations around the world. gameplay focuses on taking out  targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of  approach. where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to  you.
hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. the  experience began with a prologue and paris location in march, continued  with episode 2: sapienza in april, episode 3: marrakesh in may, the  summer bonus episode in july, episode 4: bangkok in august and episode  5: colorado in september. the season finale in hokkaido, japan arrived  on october 31st.
hitman also features a major live component, which is made up of  elusive targets, escalation contracts, community-inspired challenge  packs and contracts mode.
an elusive target is the closest thing to the hitman fantasy that  we’ve ever created. these targets will be custom-created characters that  are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time  in real-time. you’ll only have one chance to take them down. if they  escape, they are gone for good. if you kill them, that’s the way that  you killed them. there are no do-overs and no second chances. when an  elusive target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never  return.
escalation mode is something else completely new for hitman and was  created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players.  you’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to  complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements.  this mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and  mixing them up. it’s more about being playful than realistic.
contracts mode returns from hitman absolution; play-to-create, mark  your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your  friends. we will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the  featured contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever  you load up the game.

there’s more to revelations than the story mode, though – raid mode delivers countless hours of extra content, sending players through familiar locales from the game’s story with increasingly challenging enemies. rank up and unlock new weapons and parts as you complete stages, earning powerful gear and combining weapons and parts that fit your play style. go for the high score or the fastest times either solo or with a friend in online co-op, and unlock new weapon parts, abilities, and costumes for your favorite character to customize your experience even further. for veteran raid mode players, a newly remixed stage called the ghost ship: chaos has been added to push you and your characters to the limit against powerful enemies and intense encounters. if you have what it takes to survive, however, you may win even more powerful weapons and rewards!
revelations 2 focuses on a pair of intertwined stories. claire redfield returns as a member of terrasave, an anti-bioweapon organization that gets caught up in an insidious plot. joined by moira burton, the two try to escape from a desolate prison island. meanwhile, moira’s fan-favorite father and former member of s.t.a.r.s., barry burton, is looking for his daughter’s last known whereabouts on the same island, soon crossing paths with a child who claims to live on the island alone. barry will need all the help he can get, as strange creatures are prowling the halls and caverns of the island.
on top of previous dlc being included in both games, raid mode makes a return in revelations 2, offering up a wide selection of characters, new abilities and skills, and plenty of maps to put your aim and reflexes to the test. choose your favorite character, customize your gun how you like it, and fight you way through either solo or via online co-op!

Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed,"akihabara. ""akiba,"" for short.
this suburban tokyo ward's  seen it all, from japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic  bubblegum crisis of the '80s. always on the cutting edge of progress,  with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites,  it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence  would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
enter,  the “synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the  town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and  cosplayers. those victimized by synthisters take on the properties of  their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming  veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
akiba’s trip: undead & undressed tells  the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named nanashi who  was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and  transformed into one of the walking undead. he, however, was spared the  worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious synthister hunter  named shizuku. together with the rest of his companions in an  organization unofficially dubbed the “akiba freedom fighters,” nanashi  and shizuku must uncover the truth behind the synthister plague and save  akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
and of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

slayers! go forth and eradicate the oni menace! experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
trapped in an endless battle against the deadly oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. this game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
open world
from the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. the lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the oni. the otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. you will come across many colorful characters and deadly oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
evolved attacks
the ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the oni's body parts. the giant demon hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive oni into the ground with ease. you can also extinguish the life force within an oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
all-new story
you assume the role of one of the slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. during the fierce battle known as the awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to mahoroba village. waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the oni.

all-new glacier game engine – since his last outing 47 has found himself in an all new gaming engine, now with a number of new moves and a revamped npc and ai system the world of being an assassin has never been more realistic.

Bio FREAKS,"in the not-too-distant future, the mighty country known as america has fallen like all great empires throughout history. its fifty states broken into private territories after what was called... the techno-industrial civil wars. computer technology, bio-engineering, cybernetics and mechanics accelerated at such an incredible rate, it forced industrial competition to the point of uncontrollable and ruthless corporate espionage.
while the government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tail spin. these wars between giant corporations a.k.a. ""gi-corps"", gave way to more complicated, advanced and unethical methods. the kidnapping of corporate executives and replacing them with clones capable of downloading company secrets was becoming commonplace. soon, murder and terrorist tactics became tools of choice in the battle between the gi-corps.
something had to be done before the once great country destroyed itself or became target to outside invasion. an agreement had to be made between the government and the gi-corps before america was torn apart. so a radical concept was introduced to prevent the possible loss of millions in the increasing wars between gi-corp controlled states.

X-Blades,"long, long ago, in an age that only the gods can now remember, the universe was ruled by two powerful beings that were revered and worshipped by all races - but the ‘brotherly’ relationship between these two creatures was always in question from the beginning of time, simply because no one knew who the real number 1 was. while the enlightened was on the side of good, helping his people how and when he could, the dark one was quite the opposite, full of hate and devilish works - and so the never-ending battle between the enlightened and the dark one persisted for centuries. humans suffered terribly thanks to this constant combat between the two – combat which shook the universe to its very core. finally, thanks to a trick, the enlightened succeeded in banishing the divine power of the dark one, imprisoning it in an artifact - but in doing so, the enlightened lost his own divine powers, because the two divine beings were inseparably linked to one another. this is how two artifacts came to be hidden in a huge temple - and how the enlightened prevented the downfall of the entire universe. however, these two artifacts contain total, absolute power - both good and evil. any human being who comes in contact with the powerful stones will be horribly cursed - and the power of darkness will once again be awakened.  the game begins when a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up - and it shows the location of the artifacts. the adventurer ayumi starts searching for the immensely valuable stones. powerful forces against which she is helpless threaten to awake in her body. now it's up to her to discover what the secret of the curse is - and at last defeat the darkness.

X-Blades,"long, long ago, in an age that only the gods can now remember, the universe was ruled by two powerful beings that were revered and worshipped by all races - but the ‘brotherly’ relationship between these two creatures was always in question from the beginning of time, simply because no one knew who the real number 1 was. while the enlightened was on the side of good, helping his people how and when he could, the dark one was quite the opposite, full of hate and devilish works - and so the never-ending battle between the enlightened and the dark one persisted for centuries. humans suffered terribly thanks to this constant combat between the two – combat which shook the universe to its very core. finally, thanks to a trick, the enlightened succeeded in banishing the divine power of the dark one, imprisoning it in an artifact - but in doing so, the enlightened lost his own divine powers, because the two divine beings were inseparably linked to one another. this is how two artifacts came to be hidden in a huge temple - and how the enlightened prevented the downfall of the entire universe. however, these two artifacts contain total, absolute power - both good and evil. any human being who comes in contact with the powerful stones will be horribly cursed - and the power of darkness will once again be awakened.  the game begins when a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up - and it shows the location of the artifacts. the adventurer ayumi starts searching for the immensely valuable stones. powerful forces against which she is helpless threaten to awake in her body. now it's up to her to discover what the secret of the curse is - and at last defeat the darkness.

Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed,"akihabara. ""akiba,"" for short.
this suburban tokyo ward's seen it all, from japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
enter, the “synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. those victimized by synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
akiba’s trip: undead & undressed tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. he, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious synthister hunter named shizuku. together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “akiba freedom fighters,” nanashi and shizuku must uncover the truth behind the synthister plague and save akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
and of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed,"akihabara. ""akiba,"" for short.
this suburban tokyo ward's  seen it all, from japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic  bubblegum crisis of the '80s. always on the cutting edge of progress,  with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites,  it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence  would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
enter,  the “synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the  town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and  cosplayers. those victimized by synthisters take on the properties of  their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming  veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
akiba’s trip: undead & undressed tells  the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named nanashi who  was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and  transformed into one of the walking undead. he, however, was spared the  worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious synthister hunter  named shizuku. together with the rest of his companions in an  organization unofficially dubbed the “akiba freedom fighters,” nanashi  and shizuku must uncover the truth behind the synthister plague and save  akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
and of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed,"akihabara. ""akiba,"" for short.
this suburban tokyo ward's seen it all, from japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.
enter, the “synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. those victimized by synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.
akiba’s trip: undead & undressed tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. he, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious synthister hunter named shizuku. together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “akiba freedom fighters,” nanashi and shizuku must uncover the truth behind the synthister plague and save akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.
and of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…

Alias,"after attracting a cult following in the us and collecting an armful of awards, alias steps nimbly onto the ps2 with a stealth-action game featuring original story and script from the show's writers. centring on the exploits of plucky teen sydney bristow (jennifer garner) - college student by day, cia über-spy by night - alias is a sort of female version of james bond, only with better wigs. we should also mention at this point that sydney is actually a double-agent, working from the inside of the 'sd-6' division to bring down rogue operatives responsible for the assassination of her fiancé. complicated stuff, we're sure you'll agree, but it'll all start to make sense once you get stuck in. honest.
taking up the controls as intel-gathering agent with a grudge sydney, you'll be assigned various missions which place emphasis on stealth rather than scrapping, and involve gadgetry and disguises galore. never fear though, it wouldn't be alias if there weren't any opportunities for high-kicking, karate-chopping combat situations to show-off your 'expert martial arts' moves in. engage in hand-to-hand combat with multiple opponents, execute perfect roundhouses in the face of dodgy cia operatives, and make use of everyday objects as weapons.
comparisons with splinter cell and mgs will inevitably be drawn, but alias' stealth-action mix has a unique 'split-screen camera' feature which distinguishes it slightly from the ever-burgeoning genre's pack. when sydney is exploring her surroundings and attempting to locate her target (usually a vital piece of intelligence, such as a disk), the screen splits in two, with one side following sidney, and the other providing a handy peek behind any upcoming obstacles. she also spends much of her time engaging in espionage, disguising herself as waitresses and wotnot to access top-level intel, and convincing goons to spill top-secret info to her. so, whilst there is plenty of action to keep attention deficit disorder sufferers pressing on, the emphasis is on keeping things low-key and using your nous to get through levels.

delve even deeper into the adventure as gamers will play through 30 years of the beowulf story not seen in the movie to experience more of beowulf’s life and mold their own legacy. 
the mystical world of beowulf comes to life in stunning fashion. powered by the next evolution of the award-winning yeti technology used to create the critically acclaimed tom clancy’s ghost recon advanced warfighter and tom clancy’s ghost recon advanced warfighter 2, beowulf delivers an unrivalled graphical experience.

carnal power allows the use of stronger attacks and special weapons. carnal upgrades include less daze after use and prolonged use of carnal fury. but if used too much, there will be grave consequences. 
dynamic combat system including combos, parries and increasing skills as the player progresses. 
grab ability allows beowulf to hold on to walls or climb, as well as fight up close with visceral hand-to-hand combat against enemies and giant monsters.

this help arrives in the form of new playable character feanay, a fellow vipa with her own special powers. during the game, you'll sometimes have the ability to switch between sho and feanay and attempt new character-specific missions.

non-linear game progression means that you can be selective with your missions - even if you decide to decline a certain task, you'll still be able to progress and develop your character's attributes and arms, and then return once you feel that you're powerful enough to tackle it.

Hellboy: The Science of Evil,"with one successful film already out and a second due for release during the summer of 2008, this is the perfect time to be unveiling a new hellboy game, and science of evil has numerous benefits thanks to the upcoming movie.    the first, and possibly most significant is that the story the game was created from was written especially by comic creator mike mignola. his vision and creative mind were the driving force behind the very beginning of hellboy so all of the same dark humour and action the comics were and still are famed for is here in abundance. the second is that thanks to assistance from the movie director guillermo del toro, at the helm for the movie sequel, clips and action sequences from that film will be present here too and the characters from the movie also voice their characters in the game to add to the realism. science of evil, as you would expect, is a brawling action title that really shows you the brutal strength hellboy possesses. his powers can rip apart the scenery and levels and use them as weapons against the enemy and this is often a necessity as wave upon wave of attackers descend on hellboy.source - www.konami.com ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

slayers! go forth and eradicate the oni menace! experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
trapped in an endless battle against the deadly oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. this game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
open world
from the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. the lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the oni. the otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. you will come across many colorful characters and deadly oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
evolved attacks
the ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the oni's body parts. the giant demon hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive oni into the ground with ease. you can also extinguish the life force within an oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
all-new story
you assume the role of one of the slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. during the fierce battle known as the awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to mahoroba village. waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the oni.

earth is an inhospitable place for a little blue alien. thankfully cosmi is armed with the latest gizmo for covert infiltration: a capture gun. with this nifty little piece of kit he can scan the dna of humans and assume their form by using one of the ufo transformation points. possessing different forms also opens up different tricks with which to make mischief.
tricks range from the obvious (dropping tacks on the street), to the absurd (tone-deaf singing), but their purpose is always the same: to make the earthlings drop coins for you to collect and prove your mastery of mischief.
clued up on aliens in their midst, the xenophobic humans will not only get annoyed if too many pranks are played on them but they'll also give chase as your dna scanned form degrades. get caught, and you'll lose valuable coins ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

the real face of war. see it from perspective of civilians.
in this war of mine for the first time you do not play as an elite soldier, but a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of necessities and constant danger.
hide during the day. leave only when night covers you.
during the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. at night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive.
make life-and-death decisions. face the consequences.
make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. try to protect everybody from your shelter. during war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. the sooner you realize that, the better.

Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma,"ethan hunt returns to make the impossible possible in this slick caper of cloak, dagger and electronic war gun.mission: impossible - operation surma sends the ever-evasive ethan hunt and his impossible mission force (imf) crew to international locales to stop the surma corporation's latest plans for market domination. this enigmatic organization plans to unleash a lethal computer virus that can disable any computer in the world. one false step, however, and the secretary will disavow any knowledge ... you know the drill.features 

third-person adventure with emphasis on stealth 
choose different paths to complete your objectives 
emphasis on the details. carry a decommissioned guard to a door and use his hand to activate a biometric id reader 
highly detailed environments and characters put you right in the game. 

in operation surma, you won't stumble across an unholy arsenal of cutting-edge weapons to blast your enemies to high heaven. noise draws unwanted attention to your efforts. ethan instead prefers silent-but-deadly stealth. big guns aren't really needed, because ethan can silently and swiftly disptach a man with his bare hands.where operation surma lacks in weapons it makes up in gadgets second only to those of that 00 guy from england. the gadget players will use the most is the electronic lock pick, which allows you to hack into the surma security systems. set off an alarm? no problem, hack into the nearest alarm disabler. this gives the all-clear that the intruder has been captured. there's nothing like giving the hapless guards a false sense of security to give you more confidence.ethan's imf contact lenses display a level map at the screen's bottom left and give ethan night-vision capabilities to see electronic alarm tripwires and other traps that lie concealed lurk in the gloom. the electronic war gun disables surveillance cameras and creates distractions to lure guards from their posts.all the gadgets in the world, however, can't help ethan move undetected from shadow to shadow and take out surma guards. that's your job. the shadows has different shades, making finding the darkest ones vital. with the help of a stealth meter and a 360-degree view, you hide ethan in dark corners, then sneak out and surprise unsuspecting guards with quick strikes. you don't want to leave a body in plain view of a security camera, so you'll often need to dump the evidence in the shadows.running and gunning is sometimes a good tactic, but don't overuse it. in an unusual twist, ethan can try to get the upper hand against surma by forming uneasy alliances with unsavory characters.imf computer expert luther stickell (voiced by ving rhames) feeds objectives to ethan and shows the next objective's location on the map. the interaction between luther and ethan can be a bit clunky at times (at one climactic moment, luther sounds as excited as a wet rag), but luther is one sharp computer whiz.overall, the tale of espionage has more twists and turns than ten roller coasters. you get assassination, disguises, and more. is there a mole in the team?the learning curve for the controls is a short. operation surma does a good job of challenging you to think of alternative ways to tackle a sticky situation. if you have a hankering for stealth, you'll want to slip into the shadows with this addictive third-person adventure.

This War of Mine,"in the 21st century one thing is inevitable. war can break out anytime, anywhere. and if your city gets under siege, be sure you were not prepared for it.
the real face of war. see it from perspective of civilians.
in this war of mine for the first time you do not play as an elite soldier, but a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of necessities and constant danger.
hide during the day. leave only when night covers you.
during the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. at night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive.
make life-and-death decisions. face the consequences.
make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. try to protect everybody from your shelter. during war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. the sooner you realize that, the better.
