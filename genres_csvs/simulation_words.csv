Animal Crossing: City Folk,"if life were an endless vacation, what would you do? go fishing, collect        shells or watch fireworks with friends? build a snowman, exchange        presents with family or decorate your house for the holidays? take a        trip to the city, go on a shopping spree or visit friends from all over        the globe? in animal crossing: city folk, life moves at a relaxed        pace, but the world brims with endless possibilities.

there’s always something new to do. in the living, breathing world of animal        crossing: city folk, days and seasons pass in real time, so there’s        always something to discover. catch fireflies in the summer, go        trick-or-treating on halloween or hunt for eggs on bunny day. if you’re        in the mood for something a little faster paced, take a bus to a new        urban city area that’s unique to animal crossing: city folk.        there you can catch a show at the theater or check out the sales at        gracie’s boutique. but if you don’t show your face back home for too        long, your neighbors will miss you.
up to four people from your household can live and work together to        build the perfect town. design clothes and patterns, write letters and        post messages on the bulletin board for each other, or invite up to        three friends to visit your town using nintendo wi-fi connection. with        the new wiispeak microphone, it’s like you’re all in the same room. the        microphone sits atop the sensor bar and picks up the conversation of        everyone in the room to encourage a more inclusive experience.
get to know your neighbors. the heart of animal crossing:        city folk is building relationships with the animals in your town as        well as with other players. befriend your animal neighbors by exchanging        letters, gifts and favors. animals can also move from town to town,        bringing their memories and stories from their old towns with them. and        since animals are notoriously loose-lipped, they spill all the juicy        details.
express your personal style. customize your town, your house and        yourself by collecting bugs, fish, fossils, art, furniture, clothes and        accessories. you can also go to the salon in the city to change your        hairstyle and get a mii™ makeover. plus, if you design clothes in the        tailor’s shop, animals will wear them and maybe even bring them to other        towns.

with the campaign mode the player takes on the role of the trainee blaze of the osea air defense force (oadf). after a routine training mission that resulted in the death of two instructors and numerous trainees, blaze is bumped up to being an active member of the wardog squadron that includes kei nagase (edge), alvin davenport (chopper), and squad leader jack bartlett (heartbreak one). osea is subjected to strange recon activities by an unknown nation, believed to be the nearby yuktobania, a massive superpower that matches osea in military might. tensions rise between osea and yuktobania, and the wardog squadron is sent to investigate. soon, the union of yuktobanian republics declares war on the osean federation. but, this war was not instigated by yuktobania, as is believed early in the game. the fallen nation of belka (squirrel in russian), which was defeated by the allied forces of osea and yuktobania in the belkan war of 1995, sought revenge and pitted the two nations against each other.

rescue endangered animals and save their aquatic home. keep your animals        healthy, happy, and well trained, and more friends of nature will visit        your park. the more visitors, the more resources you have to pamper your        animals and transform your park into an all-star attraction.

 learn to take care of the different animals (dolphins, killer whales,          penguins, pink flamingos…) and also help to develop the sanctuary and          make it larger so that it can welcome even more endangered animals. 
 the animals need a lot of attention: they need to be fed, taken care          of, entertained and trained, in order to get them to amaze audiences          with their special tricks. 
 if the animals are happy and healthy, more and more friends of nature          will come visit the park and support your efforts. 
 each animal has an identity card which summarizes its qualities and          what it needs. some animals of the same species have different          personalities or different colors. the baby animals are often much          more fragile. 
 with the money you make, you must renovate the park, maintain the          tanks and improve the equipment. try to make the park as beautiful          possible. 
 dolphinz enables you to get close to animals and their way of life,          but it also lets you learn about the history of the marine sanctuary,          which is menaced by an unscrupulous multinational corporation. you          have to save the park so that it can continue to protect the          endangered marine species. 
 to get a good look at everything, check out your park from the sky          and, whenever you want, go down into the tanks to take care of the          animals close up. 
 throughout your adventures, you will meet different characters: a          veterinarian, a life-guard, a scientist, a sailor….. they’ll help you          carry out your missions and save the park.

Sky Odyssey,"from out of nowhere comes activision's sky odyssey. developed by a small japanese company called cross, sky odyssey has often been compared to pilotwings with its flight simulation environment and the lack of anything resembling weapons. everything can be done with the dual analog sticks on the dualshock 2--the right stick controls rudder and aileron movement while the left stick controls pitch and banking. with a number of unique environments and realistic weather patterns such as subterranean caverns and intensive lightning storms, respectively, sky odyssey certainly keeps the on-screen flight interesting. airplane selection ranges from wwii-era fighters (although they can't shoot) to ufos and pretty much every age of flight in between. bombers, helicopters, and biplanes all control differently, and the different flight models mean any of the vast, miles-wide courses can be played a different way nearly every time.

the player's interaction with their wappy dog determines the pet's constantly evolving personality, skills, and happiness.  players communicate with wappy using  commands given through the nintendo ds™ and he responds both virtually,  by wagging its tail among other tricks, and physically, with vocal  barks and movements, just like a real pet!  one that also sings and  dances that is.

players choose between ""home mode"", which enables them to engage with wappy dog through the nintendo ds™, or ""travel mode"", which gives on-the-go  players a chance to continue caring for and playing with their pet  virtually without the physical dog. when the player returns home, their  dog's progress instantly transfers to the toy as if they've never been  apart.
the game's unique features include:

communication and interaction with wappy - more  than 18 conversational prompts are answered with more than 350 evolving  responses, with each ""barked"" response translated by the nintendo ds™  software. some of the exciting interactions include wappy singing  adorable tunes in ""home mode"" or moonwalking its paws off when in  ""travel mode""!

 

intelligent and engaging behavior - building a healthy and happy friendship is the key to unlocking  wappy's many tricks. five mood states are reflected by the colors of  wappy's cheeks; an unhappy wappy will be uncooperative and stubborn, so  it is vital for players to keep its cheeks shining bright. with easily  recognizable color schemes, young players will know how wappy is feeling  at any moment.  

 

fun and exciting mini-games - thrilling games build a healthy bond between pet and owner; cooperative,  competitive or supportive games will continue to develop the friendship  while simultaneously unlocking more games for even more exciting  experiences. wappy will directly participate in games and cheers when it  wins or sulks when it loses.

 

nurture and care for wappy — wappy's nickname  can be chosen by the player who will enjoy feeding, bathing and  changing wappy's style as it matures from a puppy to an adult. five  uniquely varied age states will be accompanied by changing reactions,  songs and even the pitch of its voice. players will love caring for  wappy from precocious puppy tyke to blissfully happy adult pooch.

Zoo Hospital,"
you've graduated from veterinary college not a moment too soon--your aunt lucy just called from the world famous zoo hospital she manages because she needs your help! a local property magnate, gordon grimm, is eyeing the zoo's land as the potential site for a profitable mini-golf course. under aunt lucy's tutelage it's now up to you to help restore the zoo to its former glory by treating its ailing inhabitants, improving its zoo rating and attracting new exotic animals that will in turn attract the crowds!


treat animals by playing medical mini games with your wii remote: remove parasites, clean and pull teeth, eliminate gall stones via laser surgery and kill microscopic viruses!

use your wii remote to pat, feed or treat patients in their enclosures. find how each animal prefers to be soothed to help keep it happy and your zoo rating sky high
features 48 animals, including seven not featured in the original ds version 
2-player cooperative multiplayer mode allows players to treat the same animals together and interact with animals in their enclosures.
experience a 3d zoo environment to visit or treat its exotic inhabitants
follow up on patients by visiting enclosures to ensure animals are healing properly and quickly. the zoo rating is lowered while animals are recovering, so the quicker you help them recuperate by feeding or petting them, the quicker your rating will rise.
proper care and treatment will improve the all-new zoo rating. a high zoo rating will introduce new animals and enclosures to the zoo. be careful, though, because poor treatment and care will decrease the zoo rating and animals will leave the zoo just as fast as they came.
view your zoo rating, medical ratings and plaques earned throughout the game in the zoo hospital gallery
unlock new animals, enclosures, medical mini-games, and plaques by successfully performing procedures and raising the zoo rating.

choose your farm then start from humble beginnings: a single bird, an empty field and a few pennies. buy food, clean, and care for your bird and watch him grow. when the eggs start coming, sell them to buy more animals which you can personalize and name as you like. make sure you can feed them all though – if they can’t get food at home they’ll go elsewhere!
once your livestock portfolio really starts to swell you’ll have more money to fix up the farm just how you always wanted it, with new fences, outbuildings and more. there’s bonuses along the way for good farming and clean healthy animals including other animals or special buildings such as windmills. days pass, nights fall and the animals sleep, but you can bet they’ll wake up hungry the next day. keep them well, and in time they’ll produce their own offspring, and hasn’t everyone always wanted their very own family of baby crocodiles or rhinos to care for?
my farm around the world lets players care for different animals from the four corners of the globe, breeding them, learning the simple economics of buying and selling, and growing their very own completely unique farm. and if you’ve ever wondered how an elephant would cope in a traditional european farmyard, trade animals with your friends via wi-fi and find out!

Fishing Sim World,"fishing  sim world is the most authentic fishing simulator ever made and is  going to take you on an angling journey like no other fishing title has  done before. feel the adrenaline rush of landing trophy sized largemouth  bass and the thrill of fighting huge carp and monster pike as perfectly  combined realistic game physics and accurate fish ai create an  authentic experience that will have you hooked from the start. whether  you’re a beginner or an experienced angler there’s something for you to  enjoy in fishing sim world.,
your  angling skills will be tested to the limit by the seven different  destinations that await you in fishing sim world. each present their own  challenges and vary from huge north american lakes to picturesque  venues in europe. highlights include the sun drenched lake johnson in  florida and the glacial lake boulder in upstate new york, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and fishing sim world features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, bass cat boats. drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

other  highlights include france’s famous gigantica main lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. that’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the uk’s grand union canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
fishing sim world launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique ai and  behavioural systems. to help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from duckett fishing and  fitzgerald fishing. equip your reels with line from fitzgerald or  sunline and select the correct lures or baits from nichols lures,  missile baits and bill lewis (rat-l-trap). target carp with equipment  from leading names including korda, ridgemonkey, mainline baits and  delkim.
not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. you will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
fishing sim world reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. featuring the launch of ‘the dovetail  fishing league’ (dfl) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘angler  of the month.’ the dfl consists of multiple events split across four  different series. each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  global season leaderboard. players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for pc), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on steam and voice  chat for console.
so  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the usa, spinning for a monster  pike in england, or sat by the side of a peaceful french carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
fishing  sim world will be available to buy on playstation 4, xbox one and steam  (pc) from 18th september. in the meantime, explore the fishing sim  world hub on dovetail live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

Fishing Sim World,"fishing  sim world is the most authentic fishing simulator ever made and is  going to take you on an angling journey like no other fishing title has  done before. feel the adrenaline rush of landing trophy sized largemouth  bass and the thrill of fighting huge carp and monster pike as perfectly  combined realistic game physics and accurate fish ai create an  authentic experience that will have you hooked from the start. whether  you’re a beginner or an experienced angler there’s something for you to  enjoy in fishing sim world.,
your  angling skills will be tested to the limit by the seven different  destinations that await you in fishing sim world. each present their own  challenges and vary from huge north american lakes to picturesque  venues in europe. highlights include the sun drenched lake johnson in  florida and the glacial lake boulder in upstate new york, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and fishing sim world features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, bass cat boats. drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

other  highlights include france’s famous gigantica main lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. that’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the uk’s grand union canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
fishing sim world launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique ai and  behavioural systems. to help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from duckett fishing and  fitzgerald fishing. equip your reels with line from fitzgerald or  sunline and select the correct lures or baits from nichols lures,  missile baits and bill lewis (rat-l-trap). target carp with equipment  from leading names including korda, ridgemonkey, mainline baits and  delkim.
not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. you will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
fishing sim world reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. featuring the launch of ‘the dovetail  fishing league’ (dfl) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘angler  of the month.’ the dfl consists of multiple events split across four  different series. each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  global season leaderboard. players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for pc), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on steam and voice  chat for console.
so  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the usa, spinning for a monster  pike in england, or sat by the side of a peaceful french carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
fishing  sim world will be available to buy on playstation 4, xbox one and steam  (pc) from 18th september. in the meantime, explore the fishing sim  world hub on dovetail live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

Wing Island,"when the nintendo wii™ launched last november, we all immediately fell in love with it.  there are plenty of party games, all of which are great, but there weren’t any flying games, which would be perfect for the “wiimote.”  that is, until now!  introducing wing island!  wing island is the first wii™ game that lets you experience flight using the wii™ controller as a natural extension of your own hand! the wii™ controller features an accelerometer (yes, that's a real word!) that senses motion, allowing users to control aircraft like real pilots.  forget the analog stick!  the wii™ controller acts as the yoke of a plane.  tilt it up and planes climbs in the air.  tilt it down and planes dive.  twist it left or right and planes performs barrel rolls. pretty simple, eh?

dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigues. you are taking the role of police chief jack boyd – you’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. will jack see his retirement with a nice sum of money waiting to be spend or will he end up broken … or even worse?
immerse yourself in a controversial tale of corruption, crime, and political intrigue. manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. the mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.

your mission is clear: make 500.000$ in 180 days, before jack boyd goes to retirement. how? up to you!
decisions, decisions, decisions – this is the police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. whatever you decide, it will influence your game – and the fate of jack boyd.
the good, the bad … the ugly? the chief of freeburg’s police department is dealing with all kind of people. it is up to you, to sort out the bad boys.
follow your duties: as head of freeburg pd, jack has to take care of the daily routine – responding to emergencies, managing his officers, fighting for budget …
start and solve investigations and get evidence against the criminal gangs in freeburg.
deal with the different powers of the city: the mayor, the mafia, the church, the labor union: everyone offers you a favor, but everything has its price …
