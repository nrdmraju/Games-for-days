Super Mario Kart,"super mario kart can be played by one or two players. all gameplay uses a forced split screen view. in single player mode, the top displays the course, while the bottom screen can either display a rear-view mirror perspective, or an overhead view of the whole track, displaying where all the racers are currently. in multiplayer, the bottom screen is assigned to the second player's view. the first single player mode is mariokart gp, in which one player races seven computer-controlled drivers or ai. engine classes of 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc are available (150cc is available upon acquiring gold in all the cups in 100cc). larger engines result in faster vehicles and a greater level of difficulty. there are four cups to select: the mushroom, flower, star, and special cups (100cc and 150cc only). each cup consists of five tracks and the player must receive fourth place or better in any track to advance to the next. places five through eight are given the ""ranked out"" title. the second mode is time trial, in which the player races through one track in an attempt to set a record for best lap time or course time. three multiplayer modes are also available: the first is mariokart gp, which plays just like the single player version, but with one less computer-controlled driver. in order to proceed to the next track only one of the drivers is required to rank in the top four. the 2nd mode is match race, which is a one-on-one race on any track. the last mode, battle mode, is the only mode in which players do not race. two players choose from four levels specially designed for battle mode and try to pop the three balloons surrounding the other player with items such as koopa shells or banana peels. the last player with balloons wins. in mariokart gp and match race modes racers can collect coins which affect top speed and acceleration. in all modes, lakitu rescues drivers who have driven off the track for a price of two coins. in battle mode and time trials, there are no coins and thus no charge.

Star Wars Episode I Racer,"based on the pivotal scene in star wars episode 1, star wars episode 1: racer was a high speed, high octane racing game where only the most skilled drivers would reach the finish line.
featuring a diverse selection of tracks from star wars planets including tatooine and ord mantell, the game was a faithful recreation of the pod racing present in the film. the damage system was especially faithful, allowing racers to repair their pods manually whilst in a race.
using your winnings to modify your pod, racers had complete control over their racing, giving the game that crucial user-friendly appeal.

Wave Race 64,"various companies have produced jet ski racing games over the years, but few of those games have made as big of an impact as nintendo's wave race 64. ever since the game was originally published for the fledgling nintendo 64 in the fall of 1996, person after person has been captivated by its blazing sense of speed, gorgeous wave modeling, and realistic ""bouncy"" physics. now, you can download this wet wonder from the wii's virtual console shop for 1,000 wii points, which is a reasonable cost considering that time has done little to tarnish the game's beauty or fun.
just as the title implies, you race jet skis on turbulent waters surrounding tropical islands.
�
the nuts and bolts of wave race 64 aren't much different from any other arcade-style racing game. in the championship mode, you race jet skis around circuits on a variety of water courses. staying within the buoys will give you a speed boost and keep you from being disqualified, you can use jump ramps to leap over obstacles and to discover secret shortcuts, and the controls make it easy to glide through a turn or spin 180 on a dime with a simple yank on the analog stick. you can also perform a small selection of tricks, which are mainly useful for setting high scores in the stunt mode. other play modes include the standard time-trial mode, as well as a two-player mode that splits the screen in half and lets you compete against another human opponent.
what makes the game so much fun, and the main reason why it still holds up today, is that it conveys the exhilaration of being out there on the water in a manner that's both visceral and accessible. sharp turns and experienced cpu opponents keep you on your toes, ramps will send you flying through the air, and, because you're racing on water, you're constantly bouncing around. waves rise and fall like they do in the real world, and that motion causes floating obstacles to shift, occasionally exposing sunken posts and shipwrecks that were safely underwater on previous laps. all the while, the controls make it easy to steer, perform sharp turns, lean forward and backward, and execute tricks, usually just by yanking or twirling the analog stick. the physics and wave modeling are very realistic, to the extent that you'll soon find yourself instinctively tilting the analog stick to land quicker and hit waves at a good angle.
a decent number of polygons went into the riders and their jet skis, and they react to every bounce and jolt in realistic fashion. the 3d island courses generally look nice. some of the textures look blocky up close (mainly large rocks), but the shorelines, ramps, and course obstacles are crisp and well defined. the tropical color schemes are appropriate and appealing, as are the periodic appearances of dolphins and orcas in the water. speaking of water, the waves in wave race 64 are still some of the nicest ever modeled in a video game. thanks to the lifelike physics and splashy sound effects, you actually get a good sense of what it would be like to take a jet ski for a joyride around a tropical island.
the beautiful waves splash as you bounce and bob through them.
�
for the most part, the game looks just like it originally did on the nintendo 64. however, the frame rate is steadier, and the kawasaki advertising banners have been replaced by ads for the nintendo 64, wii, and ds lite. thankfully, the new banners aren't distracting at all. practically speaking, the only change of negative consequence to afflict the wii's version of the game is that you can't race against your time-trial ghosts anymore. the original game required an add-on memory pak for that feature, and the virtual console doesn't emulate that functionality. all things considered, being able to follow the action easier thanks to the improved frame rate more than makes up for the ability to see your ghost during time-trial runs.
wave race 64 is a testament to what happens when developers come up with a solid design and pour their hearts and souls into making their creation a reality. the game's brand of bouncy jet ski racing is just as fun today as it was a decade ago, and its gorgeous wet visuals still pack quite a punch.

Cruis'n USA," 
cruis'n usa, along with killer instinct, was to be one of the original games slated for release on the ""ultra 64"" (the working title for the nintendo 64). nintendo also promised arcade-perfect translations of these titles. they delivered on neither count. now, after years of wading through rumors and delays, the nintendo 64 has made it to the store shelves, and so has cruis'n usa. and while nintendo's game machine lives up to its billing, cruis'n usa doesn't even come close.
the dazzling qualities of mario 64 and other banner-title n64 games make cruis'n usa pale by comparison. cruis'n usa's frame rate isn't up to speed, meaning that the movement is a touch jerky. even so, the graphics are crisp and colorful, but the horizon is too close. the result is some pretty bad ""pop-up,"" where scenery simply fades away into the distance with little to no warning. the same tunes from the arcade version are present, but they come up short after being brutalized by the n64's weak music capabilities. the arcade's speech and sound effects are also present, though they're muffled.
the nintendo 64's analog stick controller really comes into play during cruis'n. after getting used to the feel of the stick, players should be able to take turns as though they were using the arcade version's steering wheel. weaving in and out of oncoming traffic is no problem. another nice feature is the addition of faster cars, each of which is earned by completing the entire 14-leg cross-country race. the game also includes hidden cars, most notably a school bus. but as much fun as driving a gray school bus may sound, it isn't a compelling reason to finish each difficulty level with each vehicle.
ultimately, cruis'n usa is a dead conversion of a dead arcade game. perhaps if nintendo had waited to release a home version of the planned sequel, cruis'n world (like they did with ki gold, an enhanced version of killer instinct 2), this effort may have been worthwhile
ever felt like driving to the golden gate bridge, mount rushmore and the white house in one day? well then, gear up to put your racing skills to the test in a frantic trip across the united states, following a route that you won't find on any map. whether it's the rolling hills of appalachia, the flowing cornfields of iowa or the crowded tunnels below chicago, you'll find yourself too focused on the intense racing action to worry about the scenery.
get started by picking from a garage full of cars to find the one that best suits your style—if you're good enough, you'll even find a few hidden ones to round out your selection. then choose one of three different playing perspectives and get ready to hang on tight. with five difficulty levels, the ability to remove traffic or other racers, and two- player simultaneous racing, it's enough to make you forget all about finding that next rest stop. just watch out for the cows, ok?

Beetle Adventure Racing!,"be ready for a fast, high-flying, and groovy experience when you play beetle adventure racing. this is electronic arts' premiere racing game for the nintendo 64 console. here's some specifics:

see some of the best graphics the nintendo 64 can produce.
race in 3 different classes, with each new class unlocked as you complete the circuits. there's even two special cars to unlock after that!
find the 3 flower boxes in each race to unlock secret cheats and gain the upper hand on the competition.
be sure to look out for the point boxes, as they unlock previously inaccessible multiplayer arenas.
there are numerous shortcuts and alternate routes to travel, so choose the fastest path to guarantee yourself a win. but remember, you only get 3 laps!

so what exactly are the tracks like? are they simple child's play? of course not! each is more challenging than the last, with six huge courses in total:

coventry cove: take a trip through the quiet countryside in this track. you can jump over boats, barrel through barns, and drive through an old castle. you might get crushed by a crane if you aren't careful.
mount mayhem: this race takes place on a lonely but large mountainside. take a chance on the ski jump (complete with a crowd), or even catch a glimpse of a ufo (odd, aren't they usually in the desert?). but watch out for the helicopters, they may get you if you stray too far of the road.
inferno isle: it's beter than jurrasic park; you get to race around a tropical island, and without getting eaten by dinosaurs! notable places are the authentic deserted villages, pirate battles, and a volcano flowing with lava. that's one hot bath you don't want to take.
sunset sands: have you ever wanted to see the pyramids? now's your chance to in this desert-themed level. there are plenty of booby traps, elevator rides, and huge statues just like the real thing. taking the wrong way has proven to decrease your chances of winning, so be on the alert at all times.
metro madness: ah, the big city. they're always full of things to do, and this race is no exception. stop at the casino/hotel for a taste of vegas, rush through parking lots, smash through a movie theater, or race a subway down its tracks. there are no cops either, so the only thing stopping you is yourself!
wicked woods: it's halloween all over again folks. spooks and scares lay at every turn. there are two ways to tackle almost anything here. will you go through the cathedral's doors or the windows up top? will you go around the dragon or right in front of him? will you stay on the normal path the entire race, or go on one with giant pumpkins? if you're really daring, you can even take a trip through a haunted house!

take a friend along the races for even more craziness if you'd like. but even crazier is the multiplayer mode, beetle battle.

catch the beetles of all six colors and head for the exit!
getting smashed loses you a beetle, so don't get taken out.
use cool power-ups like rockets, shields, and even the ability to flip your opponents' cameras!
there are 9 arenas in all, six of which must be unlocked in the championship mode.

if all that doesn't make you excited to play this game, i don't know what will. if you want a chaotic, non-linear racer to play on your nintendo 64, then this game will definitely satisfy. ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,1,1

 cockpit view: the cockpit view has been  further enhanced with the introduction of the ""look to apex."" during a  hairpin nothing can escape you. in fact, the view automatically pans  towards the path you're driving, simulating the movements of the head of  a real driver, further enhancing the feeling of realism 

 graphics and lightning: graphics and  environmental lighting are now showing more vivid colors, making all the  tracks more real and realistic. the environment is rich in vegetation,  which produces some wonderful effects of light and shadow. the  introduction of the ""haze"" effect also enhances the scenery. 

 real environment: powerful vehicles, crumbling  roads, changing conditions ... the new driving experience will allow  you to immerse yourself in the world of rally as if you were really  behind the wheel of a 300 bhp vehicle, on off-road trails, on any kind  of surface. 

 physics and damages: in wrc 2 we have  technically improved the physics. now the car behaves even more  realistically thanks to a new suspension management system that allows  the car to be more responsive to the undulation of the surface. 			the driving experience is much more fun, realistic and enjoyable.  and we also introduced new graphics for damage thanks to an enhanced  system that allows more realistic and detailed deformation following  collisions.

Circuit Breakers," motoring magazines will often tell you how much fun a small car is to drive. with power steering they're so easy to park, weave in and out of stationary traffic or nip out to the country for a spin. but let's face it, a small car is a functional thing, right? it's useful, practical and basically gets you from a to b . . . 
. . .well, yes, but then there's the small cars in circuit breakers. ever fancied driving a mini through the grand canyon? you can with this new take on the concept of the top-down racer. with a wide variety of circuits, each based on a different landscape, the only problem with driving a mini down the grand canyon is that you have the other cars to deal with. and in circuit breakers, roaring past your opponents in a souped-up monster-car simply can't be done. all the cars conform to the same performance specifications (although chassis design varies greatly); the way to win races is by nudging your way onto the racing line whilst at the same time pushing your opponents off the track. and because all the cars have the same power, the races are bound to be close-run.
dotted around the circuits as well are power-ups which you can also use to thwart your opponents . . .spread an oil slick on the track, engage a rocket booster for a burst of speed, shrink the size of your car to get through those tight spaces, or simply blow the other cars up with a missile. getting these little tricks means being first to pick them up on the way round.
circuit breakers has an impressive depth of multi-layered levels with some lovely 3d undulation going on, and with dual shock control (analogue and vibration) you feel all the bumps. the multi-player option (supporting 4-player multi-tap) brings another dimension to the gameplay as you try to score points by pushing your opponents off the bottom of the screen.

features

eyes wide shutplayers young and old, veteran or novice will be able to enjoy the look and feel of a real supercar thanks to brand new additions to the handling modes, with the ultimate aim being to graduate players through to full simulation handling.

assist mode – race with all the assists switched onto full. an amazing way to learn how to drive a supercar and learn the track, but also just great fun. tear around a track without fear of screwing things up because you forgot to brake at just the right time. this makes the game accessible to so many more people and will even see your gran cruising around silverstone on a sunday afternoon with a smile on her face!
arcade – the power of a supercar with forgiving handling and more powerful brakes. performance off road will be less but nowhere near as much as in simulation mode. breaking into corners and accelerating out of corners is far more straightforward and there’s no need to worry about spinning out all the time. you can really throw your car around a corner and have fun whilst doing it. don’t forget though – your opponents will be just as aggressive!

Moto Racer 4,"developed using unreal engine 4, moto racer 4 has revived the craze for the winning formula that made the original trilogy so successful. high-speed races on powerful bikes alternate with motocross on more nimble machines for a white-knuckle ride that remains playable despite the need for technical prowess, with rules of fair-play often put to one side. moto racer 4, which is still developed by microïds and artefacts studio, under the supervision of its original designer, paul cuisset, will include no less than 15 single and multiplayer game modes. in addition to regular fixtures such as the time trial, single race and championship, here are a few examples of what to expect:
- king of the hill: each rider starts with the same time on the clock. while time runs down for the leader, the other racers get extra turbo. the first player to get their counter down to zero wins the race.
- last man standing: the last player to pass each checkpoint is eliminated.
- survival: the race starts with very little time on the clock. players gain time by passing the checkpoints. in single-player mode, the aim is to survive for a specific length of time. in multi-player mode, the winner is the last player with time left on their clock.
- catch-up: the player's opponents begin the race with a headstart and the player must be in first place at a specific time.
- wolf pack: the player begins the race with a headstart and must maintain it for a certain length of time without being overtaken.
- ghost bike: the player starts the race in last place and is not allowed to deviate from the road or collide with others. s/he must finish in a specified minimum place.
- golden helmet: competitors must earn the one golden helmet up for grabs during therace. to do this, they must be first past the initial checkpoint. if the player wearing the golden helmet is knocked by another player, s/he surrenders it to that player. if a player falls off their bike, s/he loses the helmet and it is automatically sent to the next checkpoint.
