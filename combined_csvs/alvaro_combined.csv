Beyond Earth extended the Civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction.
After the first wave of great colony ships departed Earth, the jubilation of humanity was short-lived. Those left behind fell into a violent struggle over the quickly-diminishing resources on their barren home world. From this tumultuous time, four new factions arose. These newcomers were grounded not in the idealism of their predecessors, but on opportunism, resilience, ruthlessness, and above all a commitment to their own survival.
Now, many decades after their first landfall on a new planet, the proud survivors of the first expeditions beyond Earth look up to see the skies darkened by a new breed of pioneers.
Beyond Earth extended the Civilization franchise from its historical setting into the possible futures of science fiction. Rising Tide extends Beyond Earth to new frontiers on the planet’s surface and beneath its seas, adding even more choices and diplomatic options as you continue to build “just one more turn” toward a new vision for the future of humanity.

In 2012, the famous  detective?s latest investigation--The Testament of Sherlock  Holmes--abandoned the traditional point & click gameplay and, in a  revolution for the series, created a genuine third-person gaming  experience befitting consoles and PCS. The title earned praise from  players and critics despite some minor technical glitches and brought  the famous detective to a wider audience. The new Sherlock Holmes game  Crimes and Punishments will build upon that success with important  changes on the graphical side as well as the game experience side. For  the first time ever, Frogwares Studio will abandon their homemade  graphics engine. The latest adventures of Sherlock Holmes will be  developed on Epic?s Unreal Engine 3, allowing the series to jump far  ahead of previous installments in graphical quality. Environments will  be more realistic and finely detailed with dynamic lighting and shadows.  Choosing this engine also lets the game benefit from many technologies  like a powerful animation engine for smooth movement and animation  transitions, real-time shaders and a particle system, and advanced  post-processing effects. Unlike the previous adventures of Sherlock  Holmes, in Crimes and Punishments you will not be a mere spectator  during the detective?s investigation. It is now your turn to truly  become Sherlock Holmes and lead your own investigation--actually, your  investigations, as 8 captivating cases await you! Murders,  disappearances, spectacular thefts, and other investigations will bring  you to the cutting edge of the detective genre and these cases will be  the bread and butter of this game, written in the pure tradition of  Conan Doyle?s novels. Each case offers real freedom to players, who will  have to make important moral choices instead of simply enforcing  justice by the book. All decisions have an influence in the game and  affect your character?s reputation in addition to having realistic,  sometimes unexpected, consequences. You will have to bear the weight of  your choices, as Crimes and Punishments offers an exciting system of  actions/consequences that forces players to think before acting by  giving true depth to every decision they make. Crimes and Punishments  offers up to 12 different endings for the 8 grand cases that constitute  the game, an ambitious offering that creates a new gaming experience. In  Crimes and Punishments, players will embody a Sherlock Holmes with a  brand new look. Developers at Frogwares have abandoned the classic  Sherlock Holmes inspired by the 60s Sherlock movies, replacing him with a  more modern character perfectly matching the new artistic ambitions of  the title.

Overview
It’s the last stop.  The final destination. The BIG SHOW. It’s where dreams born in backyards are finally realized. Where the fences are FARTHER.  The grandstands are LARGER. And the spotlight is BRIGHTER. It’s where thieves run FASTER, pitchers throw HARDER and the sluggers go DEEPER. Where the bats are BIGGER, the spikes are SHARPER and the comebacks are harder to swallow. It’s where home runs are RUTHIAN and fastballs CATCH FIRE. It’s where a monster lurks in left. Where bombers terrorize the night. And where the confines aren’t always so friendly. It’s THE BIGS. And everything about them just got BIGGER.

After the turmoil caused by the assault on Lunapolis which sparked  the ""Blissful Death Wars"" (as depicted in the previous instalment),  peace seems to have been restored, with the legendary DonPachi Corps  retreating to its HQ in a space-time fold. Six years later, anomalies  are detected in the space-time fabric, yet tests reveal nothing out of  order, with the portals regularly functioning for both teleportation and  time travel; also, the leader of the DonPachi squadron Colonel Longhena  Gottvin dismisses the matter due to the lack of actual danger.
Nevertheless, a technician delves deeper into the anomaly,  discovering that something has infiltrated the HQ computer systems and  is using the portals to send large quantities of materials and data to  the past, spreading out like a virus and quickly evolving. Unsettled,  the Colonel authorizes the last transport ship to time jump in order to  fight back the invasion before future changes.
Once again, the three pilots jump back in time to 2008 and enter the  fray, the transport ship being targeted as soon as it exits the portal:  the Element Daughters, gigantic evolutions of the Dolls, are waiting...
The bee is still humming.
DoDonPachi Resurrection takes the DonPachi Corps back into the  action. Players will have the task of fighting hundreds of enemies while  dodging thousands of bullets in this renowned bullet hell title. Dash  from enemy to enemy to string together long combos and  send your score  into the stratosphere!

The story begins with a twin brother and sister learning to cook and   manage a small café under their mother’s tutelage. All was peaceful and   routine until one morning when the twins discover that their mother has   fallen into a deep sleep and won’t wake up. Suddenly, a strange old  man  appears to inform them that they must raise a dragon in order to  save  her life. Working together with three quirky café employees, the  two  siblings must figure out how to a wrangle a dragon and manage the  family  business while finding a way to save their mother.

Be cool about it. But scratch that, these little ghostly hosers called Gawoo are getting all up on the city and trying to take it over. They ain't cool, and why? Because they can't skate. They're skater-haters, just like the rest of these street peds. But they still get wowed when you bust out boarding moves like a breakdancer, and that's the whole deal with Yanya Caballista: City Skater. Koei's new skating game is one part wacky Japanese-styled insanity, then another few thousand parts more wacky Japanese-styled insanity for some of the most bizarre and funky graphic design explosions on the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system. Skate the city collecting cash and other goodies to boost your trick bag, then go after the Gawoo and drive them off the block. Show some fierce moves, and they'll take off running from your godly skills.

After discovering that the girl is being hunted by  ghostly creatures, he embarks on his own journey into the mysterious  world of rain to save her. Upon entering the world he discovers that he  has also become invisible and he must learn to navigate through the  unknown, using the rain to guide and protect him.
Throughout rain,  players control the invisible boy, leveraging the unique ability to  appear in the rain and disappear under cover to advance through the  storyline. However, just like in the real world, players must understand  that at times what they are able to see isn’t everything and they must  use their imagination to interact with the environment and solve  puzzles, and to help them along their journey to safety.
The world  of rain is shaped by introducing a unique and harmonious blend of vivid  fantasy artwork and realistic images. Combined with the expressive  sound of falling rain, splashing water and the reflective nature of  puddles as the invisible boy passes through, the game is designed to  awaken the sense of uncertainty and solitude inherent in every player.

The plot revolves around Princess Shizu, a young woman who is married to a cruel warlord named Lord Hakkaku. After an attempt on her life, she is discovered by Rikimaru and Ayama of the Azuma Shinobi Ryu ninja clan. They vow to protect her from further harm and discover the identity of her mysterious assailant.
Gameplay:Tenchu: Dark Secret places you in the Tabi boots of a pair of ninja assassins who must protect the life of a princess. Stalk your enemies with sword in hand, plant traps in the underbrush or strike with an assortment of realistic ninja weaponry—the choice is yours. With more than 40 single-player missions and the ability to construct your own weapons and items, Tenchu is sure to keep your sword hand busy for a long time.   You look down on your missions with a overhead view. All the action occurs on the top screen, and the bottom screen contains a map and shows which special item you have selected. As an enemy comes within your range, he appears on the map. From there, you can determine what pattern he moves in and plot your attack from there.   There are several ways to perform a kill an assassin would love. The safest is to set a bamboo trap. Using your stealth, sneak around the enemy's route and plant the trap in his path. Then clear out of the area. Once the trap goes off, you're safe to go back to the area and take any items the enemy drops.   You can kill enemies in any number of ways, but you'll score the big points through stealth kills and combos. Combo Kills, Stealth and Damage Taken are three of the five areas where your score will really fluctuate. You can replay a level to try to get a perfect score.  Prove your ninjapo skills by challenging friends to a local wireless multiplayer match. Tenchu: Dark Secret boasts three unique modes and a whole host of options to keep each match fresh and fun. Whether you're creeping through a bamboo forest to plunge a blade into your friend's back or setting a trap to steal his precious dumplings, you're going to need a towel to wipe the sweat from your hands.

Receiving no response, Ivy sets off through a dreamy forest, meeting many birds but none who share her resemblance. As she wanders, she stumbles upon a single glowing red feather and the first clue of her mother’s whereabouts. Presented in a beguiling storybook-like art style, Ivy the Kiwi? utilizes a unique control scheme on both the DS and Wii to guide Ivy through her daunting journey. Ivy moves back and forth freely and independently of the player through timed 2-D side-view landscapes, and is guided by the use of vines created and controlled by either the stylus or Wii Remote™ as players aim to collect more orange feathers through the stages to boost their overall score. These stretchy vines herd Ivy forward, upstairs, over walls and dangerous spikes and other menacing obstacles. Multiple vines may be created and used in conjunction, and an existing vine can be pulled in a slingshot motion to propel flightless Ivy skyward or forward as a projectile to drill through barriers and enemies. Vines bend and flex with the motion of the stylus or Wii Remote, but pulled too far and they snap! Ivy the Kiwi? features over 100 hundred stages for both the DS and Wii versions. In addition to the single-player storyline, up to four players can compete using a single-card via local wireless connection on DS or in split-screen mode on Wii. Currently in production, Ivy the Kiwi? will be released in North America by XSEED Games on DS and Wii during Summer 2010.

But some travel into the wilderness, seeking fortune. One such pair is Geoff and Vasily,who act as bodyguards for a young explorer, diving into mines overflowing with dangerous creatures.
These  explorers, known as Bergmans, long ago gained control of mines  throughout the wilderness, claiming the precious ore buried within and  using it to power the last human city and provide a peaceful life for  its more affluent citizens.
But even now, they clash with the  beasts of the wilderness, and must use whatever precious resources they  can scavenge to protect their city.
Geoff, meanwhile, dreams of  proving his worth and earning citizenship of his own. But he would soon  discover that life wasn't as simple as he once thought.

The police cannot (or will not?) help her, so Nina begins searching for clues about her father's whereabouts on her own. In the course of her investigations, she meets Max Gruber, a young colleague of her father's, who spontaneously offers to help the pretty young woman. Together they soon find out that Nina's father was involved in a previous expedition to Siberia that set out to investigate what lay behind the mysterious Tunguska catastrophe of 1908. At the time a huge explosion triggered an inferno, and the reasons behind that remain a mystery to this day.Nina and Max soon realise that events of that time are linked to her father's disappearance. Their search for answers leads Nina and Max to the most distant corners of the earth (Berlin, Moscow, Cuba, China, Antarctica etc.). Soon it becomes very obvious that some mighty opponents are also interested in the secret of Nina's father. In the end it turns out that this is about much more than just the disappearance of an old man.Features:

Feel the adrenaline rush of landing trophy sized largemouth  bass and the thrill of fighting huge carp and monster pike as perfectly  combined realistic game physics and accurate fish AI create an  authentic experience that will have you hooked from the start. Whether  you’re a beginner or an experienced angler there’s something for you to  enjoy in Fishing Sim World.,
Your  angling skills will be tested to the limit by the seven different  destinations that await you in Fishing Sim World. Each present their own  challenges and vary from huge North American Lakes to picturesque  venues in Europe. Highlights include the sun drenched Lake Johnson in  Florida and the glacial Lake Boulder in upstate New York, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. Of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and Fishing Sim World features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, Bass Cat Boats. Drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your Sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

Other  highlights include France’s famous Gigantica Main Lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘Fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. That’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the UK’s Grand Union Canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
Fishing Sim World launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique AI and  behavioural systems. To help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. Target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from Duckett Fishing and  Fitzgerald Fishing. Equip your reels with line from Fitzgerald or  Sunline and select the correct lures or baits from Nichols Lures,  Missile Baits and Bill Lewis (Rat-L-Trap). Target carp with equipment  from leading names including Korda, RidgeMonkey, Mainline Baits and  Delkim.
Not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. You will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
Fishing Sim World reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. Featuring the launch of ‘The Dovetail  Fishing League’ (DFL) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘Angler  of the Month.’ The DFL consists of multiple events split across four  different series. Each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  Global Season Leaderboard. Players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for PC), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on Steam and voice  chat for console.
So  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the USA, spinning for a monster  pike in England, or sat by the side of a peaceful French carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
Fishing  Sim World will be available to buy on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam  (PC) from 18th September. In the meantime, explore the Fishing Sim  World hub on Dovetail Live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

LEGO The Hobbit allows gamers to play through their favorite scenes from the films, following the hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he is recruited by the wizard Gandalf to aid Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves. Bilbo leaves the comforts of the Shire on a journey through Middle-earth to help the Dwarves reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor within the Lonely Mountain. Along the way, he is introduced to ravenous Trolls, dangerous Orcs and, of course, Gollum and his precious ring.

Luckily, they collide with a hovercraft and land safely on Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island, a small island made of cheese. Meanwhile, the Dreamship crash-lands on nearby Mt. Cheesemore Island.
The hovercraft is piloted by Professor Heathormen, a famous scientist who studies insects. Reader Rabbit and Sam want to borrow the hovercraft to travel to Mt. Cheesemore Island and find the Dreamship. But the collision badly damaged the hovercraft, so the professor must fix it before it can go anywhere. Unfortunately, the barrels that hold his repair materials—macaroni fruit, blue cheese bricks, and French bread loaves—are completely empty.
Can you help Reader Rabbit and Sam explore Mt. Cheeseopolitan Island in search of repair materials for the hovercraft? Be sure to collect enough items to fill up each of Professor Heathormen’s barrels. Then help the professor with his insect work so that he’ll have time to fix the hovercraft. Soon you’ll be on your way to Mt. Cheesemore Island to look for the Dreamship!
Be careful! Once you find the Dreamship, you’ll need to sneak by the hungry pirates who are guarding it. And even after you finally board the Dreamship, you’ll face one last surprise before you can head home to Wordville!

Mighty No. 9 is a game created for anyone who fondly remembers the golden age of classic challenging platformers:

Mighty No. 9 is a side-scrolling action game takes the best elements from 8- and 16-bit classics that you know and love and transforms them with modern tech, fresh mechanics and fan input into something fresh and amazing!
In the year 20XX
Our hero Beck is the 9th in a line of powerful robots designed to compete in spectacular duels in the Battle Colosseum and is the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk.

Feel the adrenaline rush of landing trophy sized largemouth  bass and the thrill of fighting huge carp and monster pike as perfectly  combined realistic game physics and accurate fish AI create an  authentic experience that will have you hooked from the start. Whether  you’re a beginner or an experienced angler there’s something for you to  enjoy in Fishing Sim World.,
Your  angling skills will be tested to the limit by the seven different  destinations that await you in Fishing Sim World. Each present their own  challenges and vary from huge North American Lakes to picturesque  venues in Europe. Highlights include the sun drenched Lake Johnson in  Florida and the glacial Lake Boulder in upstate New York, both of which  are over 2000 acres in size with endless different spots to try to catch  trophy fish from. Of course, a lake that size needs a boat to get  around on and Fishing Sim World features three high powered models  including two from our licensed partner, Bass Cat Boats. Drive your boat  at speeds in excess of 70mph, activate your Sonar and find a perfect  spot to fish. 

Other  highlights include France’s famous Gigantica Main Lake that has been  replicated in stunning detail and contains all of the known boss fish  including the incredible ‘Fudgies’ weighing in excess of 85lb. That’s  not all, a challenging stretch of the UK’s Grand Union Canal awaits and  is home to some monster predator fish including big, powerful pike that  will test your set-up to the limit.
Fishing Sim World launches  with eighteen different species of fish including largemouth and  smallmouth bass, carp and pike each with their own unique AI and  behavioural systems. To help you successfully catch each species there  are hundreds of items of equipment to choose from. Target the bass by  using spinning or baitcaster rods and reels from Duckett Fishing and  Fitzgerald Fishing. Equip your reels with line from Fitzgerald or  Sunline and select the correct lures or baits from Nichols Lures,  Missile Baits and Bill Lewis (Rat-L-Trap). Target carp with equipment  from leading names including Korda, RidgeMonkey, Mainline Baits and  Delkim.
Not  only do the fish behave differently, reacting to water temperature and  bait choice but the dynamic weather also plays a huge role in where the  fish will want to be. You will need to ensure you choose your strategy  and location carefully depending on the conditions – fish at your own  pace, find your perfect set up but be prepared to change tactic as the  weather does!
Fishing Sim World reflects the competitive element  of this great sport, allowing you take part in live tournaments against  opponents from around the world. Featuring the launch of ‘The Dovetail  Fishing League’ (DFL) players can compete with fellow anglers across the  world in individual events and for the glory of being crowned ‘Angler  of the Month.’ The DFL consists of multiple events split across four  different series. Each of the series has its own season leaderboards  with points earned added together to determine your position in the  Global Season Leaderboard. Players can also opt to fish with friends in  4-player multiplayer (8 for PC), comparing catches on real-time  leaderboards as well as communicating via text chat on Steam and voice  chat for console.
So  whether you’re trophy bass hunting in the USA, spinning for a monster  pike in England, or sat by the side of a peaceful French carp venue  waiting for that catch of a lifetime, there will be something for  everyone.
Fishing  Sim World will be available to buy on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam  (PC) from 18th September. In the meantime, explore the Fishing Sim  World hub on Dovetail Live for regular updates and new content being  uploaded daily as well as engaging with other members of the community  in our dedicated forums.

On attack, players now analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10.
 
Three new innovations change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
 
A deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode features more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, ultra-realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
 
New game modes, and innovations to popular features like Be A Pro, will be revealed in the upcoming months.

This heritage  has been celebrated in PES 2016’s new tagline ‘Love The Past, Play The Future’,  highlighting the series’ recent return to core PES values in last  year’s PES 2015 and focusing on the many new gameplay and presentational  elements that will further establish the series as the definitive  football experience.
PES 2016 aims to retain its title of ‘Best  Sports Game’, as voted across the world at games shows and by major  media outlets in 2014, by continuing to lead the way in the recreation  of ‘The Beautiful Game’. The series aims to go back to its roots to  create an exciting match between users, and proudly present PES 2016 to  deliver quality gameplay following ‘The Pitch is Ours’ mantra. From  further integration of the industry leading Fox Engine to bring the  on-pitch action to life and the full commitment to centre the product  around creating the best gameplay experience, to the full redevelopment  of Master League, every facet of the game has been enhanced to deliver  yet another outstanding product.
Fresh Gameplay – Exciting advancements reaffirming the PES series as having the No.1 gameplay.

Advanced Collision System – The physicality of the modern game has been realised in PES 2016 with a significantly improved collision system, calculating how players  interact, creating a unique outcome depending on type of impact.
Aerial Strength – With the new physicality  system, aerial battles are a completely unique experience this year. Use  the left stick to battle the opposition to disrupt a larger more  powerful player, or find the best position to make the header/volley.
1v1 Control – In PES 2016 the 1v1 player control have been enhanced, offering a wide range of  movements with the existing controls. Response times have been improved  allowing players to manoeuvre in tight situations, which also benefits  the upgraded feint moves that allow sudden directional change that can  cause defenders to lose their balance. The 1 on 1 situations now offer a  great leap in exciting table-turning outcomes. Just as the real pitch  offers opportunities for those brave enough to perform, players can pull  off precise action, flexibly manoeuvre and pull away from the defender.  Technique and timing lead to the defender to lose his balance, and  creates great chances just as you pictured.
Perfect Defence – Performing a tackle at the  perfect time will powerfully shove the player out of the way to secure  the ball. The ball will immediately be yours, creating direct  turnarounds and counter opportunities.
Intelligent Player AI – 2-3 player combination  play will be available by the improved concept of team strategy, which  depends on the type of tactic you set for your team. Players no longer  are reliant on manually triggering a 1-2, with teammates intelligently  running off passes into space.
Goal Keeper ID – In a bid to improve quality and  add unique individuality in performance, new goal keeper parameters have  been added, that now vary in Catching, Clearance, Collapsing and  Deflecting. This adds character to the players, who you can count on  catching the ball rather than punching, or are better at stopping close  range shots.
Celebration Control – New for the series, players  have full control over goal celebrations to maximize their excitement  when scoring! Prompts appear after a goal to trigger a trademark  celebration, or unique actions at the press of a button.

Fundamental Changes – New significant improvements across key modes and features.

New Master League – The famous and hugely popular  Master League sees a total revamp, allowing users to immerse themselves  in the managerial world of soccer. Every element has been redesigned or  reworked, from the vibrant and involving menus to the new and exciting  player transfer system, PES 2016 see one of the series most integral modes redefine the single player experience.
New Visuals – Incorporating the many advancements  of the Fox Engine the visuals have seen a huge upgrade. See the rain  splash as players slide in to win possession, or the turf kick up as you  strike the ball into the top corner. New night-time lighting and real  turf textures add to some of the many improvements.
Dynamic Weather – For the first time in the PES  series, dynamic weather has been introduced, with the chance of rain  starting during the game. Combined with the ever more realistic ball  physics, the rain changes how the game can be played with passes  speeding up, and players less skilled to struggle with trapping. The  defender taken by the 1 on 1 will be covered with pitch blades by  slipping and falling. This feature is applied to all offline modes  including the Master League, becoming an important element to decide the  outcome of the match.
Human Motion – Seeking to humanize player  movement, 3x new animations have been added to bring the in-game  superstars to life. Goalkeepers have seen an abundance of save  animations added, while outfield players shoot, pass, dribble and tackle  in a countless variety depending on the situation. Players complain  when a foul isn't given, or lament a teammate when a pass isn't made  when in open space. The new 1v1 control also benefits from this, with  players being able to fool their opponents with shimmies and feints that  can result in causing the opposing player to lose his balance and fall  in the wrong direction!
New Ball Physics – The past few years has seen the series make huge advancements in ball physics, and for PES 2016 new levels of realism have been reached. Each spin, bobble and ricochet  has been calculated using real ball physic data, helping keep every  moment in every game unique and unpredictable.

Quality Improvements – Many important elements are upgraded per fan feedback.

myClub – Since the launch of the mode in PES  2015, myClub has been updated on a weekly basis, and now have been  further improved based on user feedback for PES 2016.  The enhancement will introduce player level systems, and players  exclusive to the mode. Use GP acquired through matches or myClub coins  to experience realistic club management combined with players to strive  to be stronger in your squad. Choose the manager, consider coaches, and  build the strategy based on what you aim with your team. Build Your  Team, Create Your legacy!
Dynamic Wide Camera Angle – The new angles give  you a larger field of view, allowing you to better plan and adjust your  players to compete in aerial battles, or see the intelligent runs being  made thanks to Intelligent Player AI. Depending on where the ball is on  the pitch, the camera will tilt and zoom in/out to make sure the user  has the best view possible during the match.
Commentary – New commentators have been  introduced for both UK and Germany, with Peter Drury and Marco Hagemann  joining the PES team. An abundance of new lines and specific stories  have been recorded dedicated for Master League, responding to player  transfers, player growth and team performance.
PS4 Image Importing – Edit mode is synonymous  with the PES series, and further updates have been made to this hugely  popular mode. PS4 (and PS3) users are now able to import images into the  game perfectly replicating any team kit or emblem the user wishes -  including managers.

PES 2016 will also exclusively retain its use  of the UEFA Champions League club competition, which was announced  recently. This new 3 year partnership allows KONAMI to feature both the  UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League club competitions within  its many options, with both featured as individual modes or within the  larger season overview upon qualification - with the UEFA Super Cup  featured within the iconic Master League mode.

The scenario is modern warfare: It is 1985, in the midst of the Cold War, and Gorbachev has been elected to power bringing with him policies of glasnost and perestroika. However, resistance Soviet groups are opposed to the new wave and are refusing to serve the new regime in Moscow. One group has taken control of an island community, and is using it as an armed stronghold for the old order. Operation Flashpoint: Elite opens with the player joining the neighbouring US force against the Soviets. Additionally, a prequel campaign titled Resistance, set years before Operation Flashpoint's Cold War Crisis, has been added. Resistance creates an additional 100km2 island and casts the player as Victor Troska, an experienced ex-Special Forces soldier forced to lead the ramshackle Resistance effort against the Soviets before the invasion of the Malden Islands.

Solar Boy Django and Master Otenko return to their hometown San Miguel, after cleansing Istrakan - ‘City of Death - of its vampires (a.k.a. the Immortals). Instead of the heroes’ welcome they expect Django and Master Otenko find the entire population of San Miguel has become zombies!
Once more the power of real sunlight is used to purify the Immortals. In addition to Django’s trademark Solar Gun, a new Pile Driver weapon helps him dispose of the bad guys. Sunlight is captured via the Game Pak’s inbuilt light sensor, which also works alongside the Game Boy Advance internal clock to mirror the time of day. During daylight hours it’s safe to hunt down the Immortals because they are weak. However you’d better beware at night, because vampires become active and are much stronger.
It’s spooky business, and it can get tough, so if you’re scared to go it alone you can link up with friends using the Game Boy Advance Link Cable. Between 2-4 players may face the Immortals this way.

combat and trained for action. Three years ago you assaulted   
a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon   
civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Pearl   
Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the   
Union Aerospace Corporation. 
The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive   
waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and   
Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day   
consisted of suckin' dust and watchin' restricted flicks in   
the rec room. 
For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest   
supplier, has used the remote facilities on Phobos and   
Deimos to conduct various secret projects, including   
research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far they have   
been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos,   
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out   
the other. Recently however, the Gateways have grown   
dangerously unstable. Military ""volunteers"" entering them   
have either disappeared or been stricken with a strange form   
of insanity--babbling vulgarities, bludgeoning anything that   
breathes, and finally suffering an untimely death of full-  
body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to   
the folks became a full-time job. Latest military reports   
state that the research is suffering a small set-back, but   
everything is under control. 
A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from   
Phobos. ""We require immediate military support. Something   
fraggin' evil is coming out of the Gateways! Computer   
systems have gone berserk!"" The rest was incoherent. Soon   
afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky. Since then,   
attempts to establish contact with either moon have been   
unsuccessful. 
You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty   
million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were   
ordered to secure the perimeter of the base while the rest   
of the team went inside. For several hours, your radio   
picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling   
orders, screams, bones cracking, then finally, silence.

The Forest of Mist… Wrapped in a perpetual, impenetrable fog… No one knows what lies within… Just beyond the edge of the woods lies an old castle. Numerous battle flags fly proudly above its gate as symbols of its Lord’s power. It is here that King Kronus resides and rules his vast domain. During a celebration of the kingdom’s most recent conquest, Archmage Tyrhung, a powerful magician and key to the kingdom’s recent military success, stole a necklace of immeasurable value from round the Queen’s neck and disappeared into the night. Guards rushed after him, only to see him transform into a ferocious creature: a dragon. Tyrhung flew off toward the Forest of Mist, scattering the fog with his powerful wings. And when the beacon atop the Dark Spire lit up, it was clear to all: the beast had chosen his new lair… The Dark Spire, once the domain of an ancient goblin civilization, had found a new master. This is where your story begins…  Key Features • Homage to classic RPGs — Take back the age of the great classic RPGs where you build your perfect party from the ground up. Shrewd strategy is required to navigate tough dungeon floors with limited resources, earning experience by taking on 80 different enemies out to end you. • Dual dungeon modes — The traditional RPG experience is fully realized in Classic Mode, which offers a black-and-white wireframe dungeon environment reminiscent of the nostalgic PC RPGs.

But as time goes on he is ordered to undertake more and more unpleasant jobs – and he starts to become disillusioned with the life he has chosen.

Familiar chess pieces are brought to life as richly detailed 3D models, with players seeing the spectacular results of their actions in their quest for domination of the board.

The traditional white and black armies have evolved into an army of light with their brave knights in shining armor, pitted against the wicked dark army of demons and beastly golems. Each piece is intricately animated and as players move them around the board they spring into life, ready to wage war. If a square is occupied by an enemy unit, they enter into a brutal clash that sees the foe removed from the board in bloody combat.

Another evolutionary element Battle vs. Chess brings to the arena is the addition of the optional Action Mode. If selected, instead of entering a scripted animation when attacking, players challenge their opponent in a beat-'em-up style encounter. Using a variety of weapons, fighting techniques and combos, players must best their opponent in a fast-paced flurry of blows and special moves –adding a whole new meaning to the phrase checkmate. "

Breaking with  traditional game conventions where necessary, the gameplay will be based  around story, emotional involvement and the player’s decisions and  interactions, rather than high-scores, combat and competition. Intuitive  gameplay and controls are also fundamental to the experience – ensuring  that the game is mature but accessible, and avoiding alienating players  with obscure stats and complex interfaces.In Heavy Rain you  don’t watch the story – you play it. The dynamic narrative unfolds  through the players actions - not cut scenes - and every action has a  consequence. The choices you make and the way you interact with other  characters have repercussions throughout the storyline. With  unprecedented responsibility over the fates of the game’s characters,  players will find Heavy Rain an emotional experience unlike any other.  It dares to tackle subject matter and themes rarely touched upon in  video games, making it a genuinely mature game for a new world of adult  gamers. "

His vision and creative mind were the driving force behind the very beginning of Hellboy so all of the same dark humour and action the comics were and still are famed for is here in abundance. The second is that thanks to assistance from the movie director Guillermo del Toro, at the helm for the movie sequel, clips and action sequences from that film will be present here too and the characters from the movie also voice their characters in the game to add to the realism. Science of Evil, as you would expect, is a brawling action title that really shows you the brutal strength Hellboy possesses.

The prophet Harlac transmitted a message of redemption from the Heavens. Harlac gathered his people to show them their mistakes. He established the Road to Redemption and was proclaimed King. The Netherlings, an evil force that lurks in the Underworld, helped by the so-called Rebellion, stopped his plans by stealing the Redemption Stone. Harlac, trying to fulfil his plan, wandered restlessly around Akhiel fighting Netherlings and Rebels. People have suffered ever since. Some have given up hope; some believe the everlasting King will succeed.The land is in dire need of a Hero...

Slayers! Go forth and eradicate the Oni menace! Experience the latest hunting action game featuring a dynamic targeted destruction system!
Trapped in an endless battle against the deadly Oni, you must use your special abilities as a ""Slayer"" to fight alongside your allies and save the world from total annihilation. This game features the strategic concept of ""body part destruction"", which is used for fighting larger Oni and means that you must first sever and destroy their body parts in order to weaken them, before you can slay them.
Open World
From the battlefield to the village that serves as your base of operations, the game takes place in a vast open world. The lush greenery and safety of the village gradually give way to a desolate wasteland known as the Otherworld that was formed by rifts in space-time created by the Oni. The Otherworld is covered in a poisonous fog known as miasma, forcing you to establish a foothold and gradually work your way out into the world. Experience this all-new hunting action game as you discover villages hidden within dense forests, shrines standing in the shadows of raging volcanoes, and castles erected amidst the clouds. You will come across many colorful characters and deadly Oni in your journeys throughout this strange land.
Evolved Attacks
The ""body part destruction"" feature from the series returns with new features to help you sever and destroy the Oni's body parts. The giant Demon Hand allows you to perform powerful actions, such as slamming the massive Oni into the ground with ease. You can also extinguish the life force within an Oni's body part, which causes them to alter their movement patterns, thereby requiring you to consider the strategic impact of your plan of attack.
All-new Story
You assume the role of one of the Slayers from a long line of powerful warriors. During the fierce battle known as the Awakening which changed the course of history, you are sucked into a mysterious void and transported to Mahoroba Village. Waking up in this strange land with no memories of your past, you meet the Professor, who seeks the truth of this world, as well as a cast of unique and colorful characters that continue the fight against the Oni.

Criminal or Enforcer?
Players choose to be either a criminal or an enforcer and are matched against each other in fast-paced, third person action. The criminals aim to create a city rife with violent crime.

Be a Celebrity!

Could the wealthy and mysterious Max Winters be involved? New York City needs the Turtles now more than ever but they face their most trying time both as heroes and as brothers. With the fate of the City and their family at stake, it’s up to Leonardo with Zen Master Splinter to restore unity and ninja discipline to the Turtles.

Engage in over-the-top Ninja action to reunite the Turtles and save New York City.
Features

Embody All Four Famous Turtles Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo are playable, each with unique acrobatic moves, weapons and combat skills, such as Michelangelo’s fast nunchuk face slap and Raphael’s powerful Sai throw.
Extends the TMNT Movie Experience The video game uses the same dark and dangerous environments and same themes in the new TMNT movie. Will the Turtles be able to unite against the odds or will sibling rivalries create an unstoppable rift between the brothers? Only the player’s abilities can determine the outcome for the family.
Intense Ninja Fighting By harnessing the power of Ninjitsu, the four Turtles have become masters of combat. Leonardo shows a calm discipline when he faces his foes, attacking carefully and masterfully. Donatello’s bow staff can be used to reach distant enemies and as a pivot for him to swing himself around the arena. Michelangelo is a fast, flamboyant, energetic fighter, good for quick slashes with nearby enemies but for powerful direct attacks nothing beats the intensity of Raphael’s powerful Sai punches.
Unique Acrobatic Navigation The Turtles jump from rooftop to rooftop, scale tall buildings, dive into sewers and race through every corner of the city to confront their enemies. Using the Jade Engine (Prince of Persia franchise), Ubisoft’s acclaimed Montreal development team brings a unique fast-paced navigation element to the Turtles gameplay.
Powerful Tag Team Moves Together the Turtles can team up to reach locations unattainable alone, or use their unique individual abilities to find alternate routes and secret areas of New York City. By pairing up in combat, the Turtles can leverage their combined powers to create a multitude of devastating attacks to cripple the enemy.
Diverse Enemies and Bosses Characters from the movie and the original comic book series creep out of the shadows to face the Turtles. From the Purple Dragon Street Gang to the infamous Foot Clan, a new group of enemies lurks in the sewers. Find out what their plan is and how the Turtles can stop them.

Vice City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, and was the most varied and complete digital city created at its time. Combining nonlinear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with seedy opportunities and are given the chance to take it over as you choose. Take control of a variety of vehicles including high-performance cars and motorbikes, powerboats, golf buggies and helicopters. No matter what type of man you are, Vice City is always full of surprises.
Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch inside, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hodonistic metropolis of Vice City. Tommy is set up and loses everything. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. "

To save her brother, Aira has sealed Erwyn's soul within a single teardrop and transformed this into a protective orb. Now, in order to free her brother, she must safely guide the orb into the Castle of Heaven using a magical beam of light.

Discover a lush hidden world as you descend into the heart of the ocean, where ancient secrets lie forgotten and encounters with majestic creatures await.
ABZÛ is an epic descent into the depths of the sea, where players will explore beautifully rendered ocean environments with fluid swimming controls. The experience draws inspiration from the deep innate narrative that we all carry within our subconscious: the story of ABZÛ is a universal myth that resonates across cultures. The name references a concept from the oldest mythologies; it is the combination of the two ancient words AB, meaning ocean, and ZÛ, meaning to know. ABZÛ is the ocean of wisdom.

But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands.   Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves ""Dumbledore’s Army,"" Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.

Dive into the futuristic cyber-world of the Cy Girls, an all-new action thriller starring the sexiest duo in video games, Ice and Aska. Combining strength and style, this pair of spydivas takes on the nastiest of cyber-terrorists in a world where the real and the virtual coexist. Using their beauty, brains and brawn, these hot new heroines deliver twice the action!
Inspired by the Takara® range of action figures, Cy Girls is a breath-taking tale of information terrorism, computer hacking and martial arts. Starring Cy Girls agents Ice and Aska, the game spans two DVDs charting the pairs' missions, as the player is drawn into a deadly mission of espionage and adventure. The two DVDs are linked by a common story and, as the pair travel the globe in separate missions to track down and eliminate a computer wizard out to hold the world to ransom.
Each girl specialises in a particular form of combat, with Ice being the master of firearms and projectile weapons, while Aska is a master Ninja and thus trained for close weapon or hand-to-hand combat being more athletic in her approach. This is perfectly demonstrated via the game's unique eight-directional control system which allows Aska to run along walls, while both characters can perform crouching attacks and roll and loose off weapons in one fluid movement.

Released only in Japan, Radiant Silvergun offered two modes, Arcade and Saturn mode. The former is all about intense 2D shooting action, while Saturn Mode adds a storyline to the mix and features anime-style characters and voice overs. Radiant Silvergun's most interesting feature is that it did away with the power-up system so prevalent in 2D shooters and instead offered a choice of attacks -- and combos between them. From standard lasers, to split shots, tracking fire, homing blasts, rear attacks, lock-on laser, and the Radiant Sword that can act both as shield and smart bomb, players have to choose the right attack for the right enemy to make it through.In 2002, Radiant Silvergun got its spiritual successor in the Dreamcast release of Ikaruga, which would later be converted for the Nintendo Gamecube.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the world was torn in two between East and West. It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War. October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov’s research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit’s modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.  A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man’s code name is Naked Snake.  Key Features
• Experience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, previously released on PlayStation 2 with over 4 million copies sold, in 3D for the first time ever.
• Auto-stereoscopic 3D viewing capability that endeavors to create a rich jungle world with natural depth in settings of trees, rock/stone, water and more.
• ‘Photo Camo’ system utilizing the built-in camera technology of the hardware bringing customized stealth and camouflage options to the player. By snapping a photo in the real world, players will be able to use the same image as a camouflage pattern applied to Snake’s uniform within the game.
• Utilizing the Gyro Sensor, players will become one with Snake through specialized tilt mechanics throughout the game design. As Snake climbs trees, or traverses bridges and other environmental obstacles, players will be in danger of falling based on the balancing of the system.
• An intuitive menu utilizes the touch screen for quick and easy equipping of items and weapons.

About the Game
 
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is set in 2011, one year prior to the events of the  original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game.
A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the  Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of  a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the  once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped  clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone  map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost  territories.
With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to  tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the  fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories,  artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no  more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The  Factions War has begun.
The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition  between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character  experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone  right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.
What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do  anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop  them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many  other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear  Sky.

Building on the critically acclaimed Ferrari Challenge racing simulation engine, SuperCar Challenge heralds the addition of the sexiest supercars on the planet while improving on its spiritual prequel in every way.
Over 40 cars will be available to throw around the most celebrated corners on the racing calendar. Experience the thrills and spills that come with harnessing the full grunt of an Aston Martin DB9, the Ferrari FXX, the McLaren F1 and many more!
More than 20 tracks will also be available, with old favourites such as Silverstone and Spa mixed in with the joys of Nürburgring and the fictitious charms of Riviera!
Features

Eyes Wide ShutPlayers young and old, veteran or novice will be able to enjoy the look and feel of a real supercar thanks to brand new additions to the handling modes, with the ultimate aim being to graduate players through to full simulation handling.

Assist Mode – race with all the assists switched onto full. An amazing way to learn how to drive a supercar and learn the track, but also just great fun. Tear around a track without fear of screwing things up because you forgot to brake at just the right time. This makes the game accessible to so many more people and will even see your gran cruising around Silverstone on a Sunday afternoon with a smile on her face!
Arcade – the power of a supercar with forgiving handling and more powerful brakes. Performance off road will be less but nowhere near as much as in Simulation mode. Breaking into corners and accelerating out of corners is far more straightforward and there’s no need to worry about spinning out all the time. You can REALLY throw your car around a corner and have fun whilst doing it. Don’t forget though – your opponents will be just as aggressive!
Simulation – the critically acclaimed handling returns. Drop your concentration for one second and it could mean you’re out of the race! For the hardcore simulation fans only, albeit with the option to change any of the assist settings.


Gimme A Break!Your opponents’ artificial intelligence has also been completely rewritten with a brand new Dynamic AI setting allowing the game to change the challenge you receive based on how well or badly your career is going. Of course, if you fancy a real challenge you can always set the AI to Legendary… strap yourselves in tightly though because it won’t be an easy ride!
Sitting PrettyThere's a vast car customization suite at your disposal in SuperCar Challenge. Once you've bought your car you can choose from a bulging base paint swatch consisting of matte, gloss, pearlescent and metallic effects. Then it's time to let your imagination fly, and with over 500 different objects available the sky's the limit! Choose from letters, numbers, splashes, tribals, flags, racing lines and many more before positioning, rotating scaling and flipping your way to a masterpiece. By combining various basic shapes (such as circles, squares, triangles, curves and such) over as many layers as you like you can create quite literally any image you like. It's all down to your imagination.

Nobody knows who built it, or when it was built.
Some say it holds treasures that could control the world, treasures that could make one immortal, and a slumbering demon king whose awakening could end the world. But no one knows for certain. What is known is that the labyrinth is filled with cursed miasma, a substance that brings death to any human it touches.
One day, a witch arrived at Refrain with the intention of exploring this labyrinth. Her name was Dusk Witch Dronya. She had in her possession a legendary book, said to have been written by the only man to explore the labyrinth and survive. The Tractatus de Monstrum...
Systems

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf. Since you are just a mere book, you must rely on the many puppet soldiers that you can bring into the labyrinth to fight for you. Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole.

Players can build and maintain a thriving Roman city, develop armies, defend their territory against invading neighbors, or, if they choose, take over the empire by exploiting resources and charming the emperor for power and promotion.  Caesar III builds upon its predecessor in two major areas. First, an entire province is shown on one large map for more seamless gameplay. Rather than monitoring separate screens for city, countryside and battle, all of the game's action takes place on one level. This innovation makes the most dramatic difference in combat. Instead of sending troops off to an anonymous battlefield, there will be street-to-street fighting if the player's defensive measures fail. Another new feature in Caesar III is that the real-time effects of almost all the player's actions are immediately visible on-screen. Before, it was necessary for players to go to report screens to assess their strengths and weaknesses in various aspects of their governance. In Caesar III for example, unemployment and rioting in the city are instantly apparent, as citizens will be seen sitting around or rampaging through the streets. Moreover, the player may ""chat"" with any of the countless citizens bustling around the city for useful information about the success or failure of the city The game also features a highly intuitive interface, a new musical score, and richly-detailed animations, structures and terrain elements - all of which make Caesar III a game that city-building fans everywhere will look forward to seeing on their PC.

Settling the  heritage is merely an excuse for David to find out more about the castle  his father grew up in, meeting the family he never knew and for  shedding light on the mysteries surrounding his father’s death.
Tormented by nightmares and waking dreams for all his life, he fears  that it might be his destiny to follow in his father’s footsteps, down a  path that leads to madness and death. Is there really a curse that has been haunting his family for  generations as his father believed? Or are the mysteries hidden inside  the cold walls of Black Mirror house of a far more wordly nature?

In order to travel the Flipper Critters' world, you'll need to complete        objectives on each level. Sometimes you'll only have to open a door and        roll along a ramp, while on other occasions, you'll have to activate a        vehicle and use that to travel to a new place.

For some reason unknown to us, Rabbids decide to take over our beloved amusement park.
We do not know their plan; we do not know their intentions. But one thing we are sure of: they are going to make the most of their day out by invading all the attractions!
They don’t intend to queue like everyone else or stay seated during the whole journey!
As Rabbids will always be Rabbids, you’ll see them misusing the rides, going bwaaah at a souvenir shop before stopping in an overpriced themed restaurant.
So whether it’s a sunny or rainy day, just grab your Wii U GamePad and roll the dice to join them!
Discover how the Rabbids take over the attractions
Rabbids will have a lot on their plate: princess castle, the pirate boat, haunted house, tunnel of love, roller coaster…there are over 20 + attractions waiting to be invaded!
A unique board game with unexpected events
The board game is the center of Rabbids Land and all the action revolves around it. It’s an arena where you’ll be able to play up to 4 players, turn by turn in sessions of 30 to 60 minute. The board game has many to offer: special events that will change all the rules of the game, plus unique items to beat up your friends and steal their trophies. You’ll even get to ask stupid questions, and catapulted to the attractions!
Use the Wii U GamePad in delirious ways
Whether you aim with it, use it to plan your next move, tilt it, shout at it, watch it, steer it, share it, touch it, draw on it, … Rabbids Land is going to make you see your new console in a brand new light through its wacky interactions
There is always two sides to a story
The WiiU GamePad shows its core value through the asymmetrical gameplay it offers. Letting you play coop and versus mode in the attractions. Not only the experience of the game will be lived differently from a player to another, but the replay value is considerably high.
Fun on & off screen
Some attractions will challenge you and your friends to shout at each other, make one and another dance and push you to interact not only with the controller, but also between your buddies.
Use the Wii U without TV
Someone else is camping in front the TV? No problem, with the WiiU tablet you’ll be able to play the full game on your own.

Using military might, diplomacy,  subterfuge and assassination, this is a struggle to reach and retain  the Imperial throne.   But that's no small feat.

Ever since the events at the end of Overlord: Raising Hell, the Overlord has been absent from the world and, without his firm grip on the kingdom, the lands have being conquered by the Glorious Empire. On the surface, the Glorious Empire is a civilisation driven by righteous politicians and supported with a mighty military force. However, in practice the Empire is decadent, corrupt and dangerous. And if there's one thing the Glorious Empire hates, it's magic and magical beings.  As the game opens, the Empire’s Inquisition is on the hunt for anyone who has magical resonance. In the Arctic wastelands, where Yetis roam, lies the snowy town of Nordberg. Here a young lad is singled out by the Inquisition and accused of possessing a magical force (what with him having strange glowing eyes and everything). However, as he is led off, the Empire guards come under attack from a band of strange little leathery, big-eared, yellow-eyed beasts: it’s the Minions! With a rousing cry of “Master” the devilishly charming critters carry the boy off – they’ve found their new Overlord.  After some years of intensive Minion training, players will step into the now-adult sized boots of the Overlord. Initially it’s a rag-tag band of Minions under his command but off they go, looting, destroying and laying waste to the lands around Nordberg, scoring victories where they can, before setting sights on the lands at the very heart of the Empire.  As the Overlord’s powers grow, the secrets of the Empire, and those of his own origins, will be revealed and then it’s time to go Minion maximus on the Empire’s collective ass. Players will be able to choose how to wield the Overlord’s evil forces. Do they plunder and pillage across the lands, burn cities on a whim in wild acts of destruction? Or do they follow a path of domination, enslaving towns and exerting their will upon the people? Only true despots will be able to make the ultimate choice between being a ‘destructive’ or a ‘dominating’ dark lord. "

Intense battles span Europe and North Africa as gamers play as Soviet,  Allied or German forces.


Men of War takes place in Europe and North Africa during the height  of World War II. The story takes place over three different campaigns  and players take on the role of Soviet, Allied and German soldiers. Each  campaign has its own scenario and structured timeline, which brings  different elements of the war to life.
The game features hundreds of accurately modelled historical tanks  and vehicles — including new designs of tanks, APCs and heavy guns — all  of which are ready for your command. Dynamic in-game cutscenes enhance  the single-player by telling the plot, without pulling the player out of  the game experience. What's more, the sounds of war have been given a  new lease of life, with more than 1,000 sounds effects of weapons and  combat gear; all recorded under real operating conditions.
The single-player campaign also features a customisable  user-interface, so players can have the command controls laid out in  their own style. One of the biggest changes for Men of War is the  inclusion of a comprehensive multiplayer, featuring new maps and modes,  including Capture the Flag, High-Value Cargo and more. Also, there's a  refined rating system to ensure a fair fight in online multiplayer  battles.

A world called Tanis. The mysterious town of Refrain resides there.Deep beneath that isolated and forsaken town lies an unexplored underground labyrinth. Nobody knows who built it, or when it was built.
Some say it holds treasures that could control the world, treasures that could make one immortal, and a slumbering demon king whose awakening could end the world. But no one knows for certain. What is known is that the labyrinth is filled with cursed miasma, a substance that brings death to any human it touches.
One day, a witch arrived at Refrain with the intention of exploring this labyrinth. Her name was Dusk Witch Dronya. She had in her possession a legendary book, said to have been written by the only man to explore the labyrinth and survive. The Tractatus de Monstrum...
Systems

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf. Since you are just a mere book, you must rely on the many puppet soldiers that you can bring into the labyrinth to fight for you. Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole. Battles consist of multiple covens attacking and defending themselves from enemies.

Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort’s defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane’s chocolates! And then there’s Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.In the game of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory.

This year's edition of the winter sports simulation was completely reworked in order to use the next gen consoles' functions to their greatest advantage. Apart from the attractive sports such as boardercross, ski flying, alpine skiing, freeride skiing, short-track speed skating, figure skating, bobsledding, and biathlon, players of Winter Sports 2010 also have a complex career mode to look forward to.
In the story-based career mode, players can invest any experience points they collect in improved skills and equipment for their characters, and work their way up from beginners to world-class athletes. All of this takes place within a gripping story in which the player takes part in 16 competitions against four national teams. As an added challenge, one of those teams is the player's ultimate rival, and particularly hard to beat.
Winter Sports 2010 also provides ""casual"" entertainment: In single discipline mode, players get to take part in the event of their choice in order to hone their skills in that discipline. Veterans also get their money's worth in Winter Sports 2010. The extended trick system for the disciplines of boardercross and freeride skiing provides the ultimate challenge for experts.
Winter Sports 2010 will also thrill fans of multiplayer games. Up to four friends may compete for the top position in the championship rankings - there can be only one champion, after all.
Eight unique sports disciplines and full online support for all platforms for the first time ever, make for hours of gaming fun. The online mode ""fair play"" launches an event where each participant controls an equally skilled athlete, thus showing the players' real strengths and weaknesses in every discipline. On the other hand, the players' individually trained avatars get to compare their abilities in the online ""tough mode"".
Features:
-       Eight unique and distinct sports: boardercross, freeride skiing, alpine skiing, ski flying, short-track speed skating, biathlon, bobsledding, and figure skating
-       Five game modes: career, cup, single course, campaign, multiplayer
-       Four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, extreme
-       Fair play strips help identify ""good"" and ""bad"" players in the career and online modes; the players' behavior is immediately reflected in the fair play strips
-       Story-based career mode with role-playing elements, special skills, and upgrades
-       Campaign with 44 gripping challenges
-       Multiplayer: online and split-screen modes (up to 4 players)
-       Online mode with a world-wide ranking system
-       Extended trick system for boardercross and freeride skiing
-       Appealing commentators create an authentic competitive atmosphere
-       Next gen system of graphics and physics

In an abyss of infinite chaos,
God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Add to that incredible acoustics, state of the art particle technology, HDRI and multilayer 3D sound, realistic tilt function and motion blur effects, and you have the best pinball experience available on the PC that can even be enjoyed by laptops and less powerful non-gaming computers.

Throughout the world, martial arts experts are disappearing. Police from various nations are cooperating in an international manhunt to find the criminal responsible for the murders.

The Town of Light
12 March 1938. Renée, 16 years old, is ripped out of her world, locked up and deprived of everything. Her only fault was that she didn't know what her place in the world was. ""A danger to herself and others and a cause of public scandal"" wrote the police headquarters. The only horror you will find in this game is the truth: a blow to the solar plexus, much more intense than any supernatural presence
The Town of Light is a psychological adventure told in the first person. The story is set in Italy in the first half of the 20th Century in a place which really existed and has been meticulously reconstructed. Exploring and interacting with the environment you will relive the history of the main character through her confused viewpoint and on the basis of your choices, the story will develop in different ways.

The Town of Light
12 March 1938. Renée, 16 years old, is ripped out of her world, locked up and deprived of everything. Her only fault was that she didn't know what her place in the world was. ""A danger to herself and others and a cause of public scandal"" wrote the police headquarters. The only horror you will find in this game is the truth: a blow to the solar plexus, much more intense than any supernatural presence
The Town of Light is a psychological adventure told in the first person. The story is set in Italy in the first half of the 20th Century in a place which really existed and has been meticulously reconstructed. Exploring and interacting with the environment you will relive the history of the main character through her confused viewpoint and on the basis of your choices, the story will develop in different ways.

Earth is an inhospitable place for a little blue alien. Thankfully Cosmi is armed with the latest gizmo for covert infiltration: a Capture Gun. With this nifty little piece of kit he can scan the DNA of humans and assume their form by using one of the UFO transformation points. Possessing different forms also opens up different tricks with which to make mischief.
Tricks range from the obvious (dropping tacks on the street), to the absurd (tone-deaf singing), but their purpose is always the same: to make the earthlings drop coins for you to collect and prove your mastery of mischief.

In an abyss of infinite chaos,
God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Noah’s solution, however, was to exterminate its creators. In a matter of days, civilization fell to terrifying weapons and monsters created by Noah. This cataclysmic event came to be known as the Great Destruction.
As the years passed, the number of human survivors grew, slowly but steadily. They formed villages and towns, living off of technology that they were able to salvage from the piles of wreckage.
Among the survivors were those who rose up to fight Noah's robotic henchmen. To track down and eliminate these threats to humanity, they utilized the most powerful weapons still operable after the Great Destruction—tanks! As a sign of respect, people nicknamed them “hunters.”
Noah, the cause of the Great Destruction, was in fact destroyed by one such hunter. However, its ruthless offspring still roamed the world, striking fear in people’s heart.

During her period of training, the heroine commits  herself solely to dancing. Her dream is to become a great prima  ballerina. But the path to success is full of challenges. Also, she  should never underestimate her fellow students, because some of them  would do anything to outdo their competition. But only the best will get  a chance to shine, and therefore players will have to keep proving and  improving their skills. Luckily, they are getting support from Nathan, a  young, very talented dancer, the heartthrob of every girl in the  academy.

This man had dispatched assassins to bring down Duke, the leader of ""Mephistopheles,"" an up-and-coming gang in the area...

They owe a debt of gratitude to Fate, who looked after these two when they were kids.  Alba happened to be present at the assassination of Duke, which triggered subsequent incidents. Consequently, Alba was regarded as a traitor, but Alba's younger brother and his fellow gang members work to clear his name.  -THE PRESENT- With the death of Fate, the balance of power has tipped and all gangs await the opportunity to rule the underworld.  To restore order to the chaotic downtown scene, Alba attempts to contact Duke. Hyena, assuming the role of mediator, relays the conditions for a meeting with Duke.  The sole condition: ""If you want a meeting, first you must battle and defeat all those whom I designate.""  Alba swallows this cynical circumstance so that he himself may bring things to a conclusion with Duke.  Meanwhile, Soiree swings into action.

Metroid Prime is a first-person adventure game. Players control a bounty  hunter named Samus Aran who must unravel a mystery behind the ruined  walls scattered across Tallon IV.
The game opens just as Samus' spaceship docks on a Space Pirate vessel  orbiting the planet. Immediately, the beautiful graphics slap you across  the face. Trust us, it's a firm slap. A silky-smooth framerate  accommodates razor-sharp visuals of efficient machinery and foreign  architecture. Meanwhile, a cinematic soundtrack sets the mood and eerie  sound effects thicken the alien atmosphere.
By far, the most effective visual effect is that everything you see is  viewed through Samus's visor. The entire screen has a convex look, and a  digital display provides information ranging from current energy levels  to ammunition data. The most effective ideas are sometimes the most  simple, and the visor view in Metroid Prime makes a huge leap forward in  immersing players in the first-person perspective.
Samus uses a Power Beam to shoot a series of locked switches, and  eventually enters a cylindrical corridor very similar to the passageways  found in the original Metroid titles. When Samus strides by broken  pipes spewing steam, the visor becomes smeared with condensation. Later  in the demo, the visor is splattered with the internal juices of  ruptured enemy carcasses. Yes, life within Samus' gravity suit is a  beautiful thing.
Weapon effects are equally pleasing. Hold the A Button to juice up the  Charge Beam, and you see the corridor glow and warp as the blast travels  through space. Enemy animation is delightfully disgusting, whether it's  a giant parasite queen squirming from the ceiling or a swarm of  blood-thirsty critters gushing from a dark hole. Take note: the word  ""swarm"" has been misused in video game reviews for years. With Metroid  Prime, we can use the word ""swarm"" and feel perfectly justified. The  screen fills -- FILLS -- with baddies, and the framerate doesn't even  blink.
In the Gravity Suit
Of course, graphics are just the glossing on the gravity suit. No matter  how good a game looks, it won't get fired up more than once without  solid game design and user-friendly play control. In Metroid Prime, both  are spot-on.
How do you know if play control is good? If you don't think about it,  it's perfect. Once you get a feel for the Controller configuration in  Metroid Prime, you spend 100% of your time worrying about blasting  enemies -- not thinking about the play control.
The Control Stick moves Samus around, the A Button fires weapons and the  B Button makes Samus jump. Press and hold the R Button to enter an  aiming mode which allows you to freely look around the environment. The L  Button activates an automatic lock-on feature, which makes for easy  strafing while firing at a targeted enemy.
Changing weapons is as easy as moving the C-Stick. By pressing different  directions on the D-Pad, you can activate the different features of  Samus' visor. A variety of visor modes are available including Combat,  Scan, Thermal and more. Combat is the normal view, and Scan produces a  slightly magnified rectangular viewing strip in the middle of the visor.  By pressing and holding the L Button, Samus can scan various items in  the environment. Sometimes a scan simply provides additional  information, and other times scanning an environmental element can  activate a switch or identify and enemy's weak spot.
Pressing the Y Button activates Samus's missiles, and the X Button  engages the Morph Ball. The game switches to a third-person perspective  while Samus is in Morph Ball form. In Morph Ball form, Samus can roll  through tight quarters, place bombs, activate switches and much more.
Exploration is Key
When Samus lands on Tallon IV to begin her investigation of Space Pirate  activity, the bounty hunter is stripped of most power-ups. It's up to  you to explore the world and recover the many power-ups and weapons  which gradually open more and more gameplay areas.
Although this is a first-person game with plenty of shooting action, the  heart of the experience is highly exploratory and adventurous. Enemies  abound, but there are just as many elaborate puzzles to solve as there  are bad guys to blast.
For an immersive adventure unlike anything you've played before, get  behind the visor and see what's it like to be Samus Aran in Metroid  Prime.

It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.

One day, a witch arrived at Refrain with the intention of exploring this labyrinth. Her name was Dusk Witch Dronya. She had in her possession a legendary book, said to have been written by the only man to explore the labyrinth and survive. The Tractatus de Monstrum...
Systems

Conquer the Labyrinth - As the Tractatus de Monstrum, a legendary book owned by the witch Dronya, you are tasked with exploring the labyrinth of Refrain on her behalf. Since you are just a mere book, you must rely on the many puppet soldiers that you can bring into the labyrinth to fight for you. Each puppet soldier is handcrafted by Luca and has different battle skills.


Look Out for Monsters Roaming the 3D Halls - The labyrinth itself is a 3D dungeon that the player will explore from a first-person perspective. On the map, enemies are represented by symbols. Coming into contact with these symbols will trigger a battle.
Covens: The Soul of Your Witch Brigade - In Labyrinth of Refrain: Coven of Dusk, players will explore the labyrinth while commanding characters arranged in groups called covens. A single coven can contain multiple puppet soldiers. Each soldier's power and skills affect the performance of the coven as a whole. Battles consist of multiple covens attacking and defending themselves from enemies.

Throughout the game the player can: transform into any of 15 character types inheriting unique abilities, build and pilot ships with hundreds of permutations, engage in explosive combat, participate in life-on-the-line races, and freely explore a truly dynamic and living world.

The game is structured in missions whose objectives are always ""doing things"", instead of ""finding out how to do them"". That is, the player will never wonder what to do, which object he needs or which character he has to transform into to accomplish a mission; The game itself provides that information constantly and clearly. Fun and challenge lie in what happens and how the system reacts when the player does what he is asked to, when he uses the object he needs or when he transforms into the precise character. "

In the dark days of the end of World War Two amidst the ruins of Berlin, one bullet can change history…

Sniper Elite V2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the  highly-acclaimed Sniper Elite, giving gamers the most authentic World  War II sniping experience available. You are elite US sniper Karl  Fairburne. Parachuted into Berlin amidst the Germans’ final stand, your  mission is to prevent Nazi V2 rocket program technology from falling  into the hands of the besieging Red Army. You must aid key scientists  keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the  Russians.
Take advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your  targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill,  patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the  key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race  against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite  returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are  rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are  graphically rendered in X-ray as the bullet enters and destroys your  victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact  of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life.
As World War II ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts. Use it wisely.

All of the powerballs significantly alters the ebb and flow of each game and allows each player to develop their own unique strategies in their quest to be the first to score five goals and win the game!Geon features a variety of single player and multiplayer modes including Duel Career Mode where your aim is to progress to the top of the four Geon leagues, or Duel and Time Attack modes which features 16 and 32 unique grids respectively and where mini games can be unlocked along the way. Alternatively take on your friends in two or four person split screen multi-player battles to become the undisputed Geon master!BRAND NEW Wii FEATURES

Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

The games are interesting combinations of science-fiction storylines and history. In COMMAND & CONQUER: RED ALERT, for example, players find themselves in an alternate history where the allied forces are battling Stalin and a powerful Russia instead of Germany because, after inventing a time machine, Einstein killed Hitler. It's interesting storylines like this that make the series so much more than the typical RTS game. Twelve different COMMAND & CONQUER games are included in THE FIRST DECADE package, including the original game, RED ALERT, TIBERIAN SUN, RENEGADE (a first-person shooter set in the C&C universe), RED ALERT 2, YURI'S REVENGE, C&C GENERALS, ZERO HOUR, and more. All have been updated to run on Windows XP. All of the games take different approaches and are often set in different worlds, although some are direct sequels. However, the well-written storylines and addictive gameplay remain the same through each game, with each successive game tweaking the mechanics a bit. Players will find the first C&C game does play a bit differently than the more recent ones, but the controls aren't so outdated as to make the game no longer fun.

SAW is a third-person perspective, survival horror game based on the SAW film franchise, which has grossed more than $665M worldwide and sold more than 28 million DVDs.  The game features many of the deadly mechanical traps seen in the film, as well as terrifying new ones.  Players will pit their wits against Jigsaw as they navigate his world in an attempt to evade and escape his gruesome traps, while also struggling against his minions in brutal combat by using weapons found within the environment.
SAW, the video game, is based on a treatment from Zombie Studios and the creators of the SAW franchise, Leigh Whannell and James Wan.
The timeline for the game takes place between the movies: SAW and SAW II, giving the game its own story, yet fitting within the narratives of the movies.
The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw.  Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp's mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp's career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw's traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game-the likes of which he has been investigating for years-to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others. But each victim has a dark connection to Tapp. Will Tapp save them? Can he survive his obsession to find the Jigsaw killer?
Product Features

Traps of Lethal CunningJigsaw has laid out a gauntlet of torturous traps for a handful of innocents. Only you stand between them and the most brutal death imaginable. Think quickly and act! The clock is ticking.
Choices of ConscienceThe player is forced to make difficult moral choices. Who lives and who dies in the game is determined by the player's choices.
Mysteries RevealedUnanswered questions from the films are finally laid to rest. Gamers will discover the origin of Jigsaw and why he devoted his life to games, while also finding out what happened to the characters from the first SAW movie.
An Ecology of TerrorThe asylum in which Jigsaw has trapped you is abandoned, but it is far from empty. It is a living world of horror populated by Jigsaw's minions and the insane souls they torture... and they have no intention of letting you leave.

Game Features

 THE ROAD TO THE WRC:  															Live the life of a real rally driver through the career  mode of WRC 2. Start from scratch by creating your own racing team,    win prestigious victories to increase your funds and improve your  reputation. Among the brand new features this year, you can create  your own team and manage them during your ascent to the WRC. Find the  best mechanics on the market to maximize the performance of your car,  hire skilled managers to unlock profitable sponsorships ... and strive  to earn a contract with one of the WRC teams.  Are you ready to become the new champion of the world? 

 SINGLE PLAYER MODE: In addition to  the Single Stage, Single Rally and Championship, amongst the classic and  established game modes .The new WRC Rally School has been improved in  order to teach you the basics of the guide and to refine the techniques  used by champions. In WRC2 now you can additionally take on the famous  Super Special Stages, in which two cars compete at a time on  two-parallel-lanes tracks. 

 HOT SEAT: In the Hot Seat mode, up  to 4 friends can challenge each other on a Single Stage, a Single Rally  or an entire Championship, playing one after the other. Who be the local  champion 

 ONLINE: Play online with friends,  challenging them in the Single Stage, Single Rally or Championship. Your  results will affect your ranking online as you try to become the best  rally driver in the world. This year, the Super Special Stage mode will  also be available online... so you can challenge opponents in a 1on1  competition with updated online rankings, that will show the best  ""duelists"" in the world 

 PHOTO MODE: Starting also this year  players can capture the most exciting moments of  races, through the  new photo mode. Just put the game on pause, frame the car and shoot.   Then if you really want to show off apply some of the many special  visual effects. 

 REWIND EFFECT: Didn't take the  corner quite right, no problem?  With this new game feature you can  rewind time and return a few seconds before it all went wrong. The  feature also helps inexperienced drivers master new tracks 

Improvements

 CO-DRIVER: With a passion to make this the  most authentic rally experience. The team at WRC2 took direction from  professional co-drivers so the in-game notes have been improved in every  rally, increasing the levels of information and making the timing of  co-driver instructions as accurate as possible. 

 REAL SOUNDS: Bring the roar of the engines of the WRC cars into your living room!  					Thanks to the many different recording sessions performed in  the field, the in-game sounds of cars have been made even more faithful  to the real ones! 

 GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of each Special Stage  has been improved thanks to meticulous attention to detail making the  streets even more faithful to those of the World Rally Championship.  This year you will face tight hairpin turns, rough terrains, winding  curves and sudden changes to the surface conditions 

 COCKPIT VIEW: The cockpit view has been  further enhanced with the introduction of the ""look to apex."" During a  hairpin nothing can escape you. In fact, the view automatically pans  towards the path you're driving, simulating the movements of the head of  a real driver, further enhancing the feeling of realism 

 GRAPHICS AND LIGHTNING: Graphics and  environmental lighting are now showing more vivid colors, making all the  tracks more real and realistic. The environment is rich in vegetation,  which produces some wonderful effects of light and shadow. The  introduction of the ""haze"" effect also enhances the scenery. 

 REAL ENVIRONMENT: Powerful vehicles, crumbling  roads, changing conditions ... the new driving experience will allow  you to immerse yourself in the world of rally as if you were really  behind the wheel of a 300 BHP vehicle, on off-road trails, on any kind  of surface. 

 PHYSICS AND DAMAGES: In WRC 2 we have  technically improved the physics. Now the car behaves even more  realistically thanks to a new suspension management system that allows  the car to be more responsive to the undulation of the surface. 			The driving experience is much more fun, realistic and enjoyable.  And we also introduced new graphics for damage thanks to an enhanced  system that allows more realistic and detailed deformation following  collisions.

Two warring factions arise from the rubble: the Echelon, a technologically advanced race that endured the planet's fallout by way of self-induced hibernation, and the Sai, a tribal society that adapted to the new apocalyptic environment and evolved over time.Units Descriptions
Echelon

EnforcersEnforcers are the troops on the frontline, bringing peace and security to all who fall under the wing of the Echelon. Determined to bring the civility of the past to the chaos of the frontier, Enforcers serve with utmost loyalty to the Chancellor. They are protected by tactical combat armour and heavily armed with an assault rifle/grenade launcher combo.

Grenades: The Enforcers can launch a barrage of explosive grenades at their enemies.
Riot Shield Up: The Enforcers activate their energy Riot Shields and hunker down behind them for increased protection.


InfiltratorsThe arbiters of justice, Infiltrators seek out the hidden enemies of the Echelon and dispatch them with a high velocity shot to the skull. Trained from a young age to join the elite ranks of the Echelon infantry, Infiltrators are supreme scouts and deadly accurate snipers. All Infiltrators are armed with the best field camouflage armour and a large calibre high velocity rifle. The Infiltrator always strikes its target.

Thermal Vision: The Infiltrator is able to detect and target any hidden and cloaked units within view.


ProwlersProwlers are moderately armoured but highly mobile vehicles that provide security both on the ground and in the air. Unmatched for their versatility, Prowlers engage land and air targets with turret-mounted twin cannons. Echelon Commanders know that when these cats are on the prowl, the enemy better watch out!

Search the Skies AA Mode: The Prowler transforms into a stable gun platform to shoot down airborne targets.



Sai

RangersRangers perform two functions within the Sai hierarchy. Firstly they scout the frontiers for dangerous mutants, alerting Sai villages if they are in danger and secondly, Rangers form into Militia Platoons in time of war, providing the most common form of troops available to Sai commanders. Armed with basic armour and an assault rifle, Rangers are best deployed in numbers. When the Rangers’ battle fervour is heated they will charge into combat heedless of danger. They can also fire Sai energy charges at air targets.

Sai Anti Air Rockets: The Rangers can fire Sai energy charges at airborne units from their unusual weapons.
Commando Rush: The Rangers call forth their natural aggression and rush into combat completely ignoring the dangers around them but increasing their damage.


SpectresThe silent knives in the night, Spectres are a true nightmare for Echelon soldiers to handle. They have an exceptional ability to control Sai energy, having been trained from a young age to manipulate the energy in different ways. Able to project swords made out of energy from their arms, the Spectres can slash their way through nearly all opposition. The Spectre can also bend light at-will to cloak itself, making it nearly invisible to the naked eye, only being given away by a slight shimmer. The fact that Spectres can also use mind control could be the most terrifying thing of all.

Mind Control: The powerful mind of the Spectre can temporarily dominate any enemy except for commanders.
Cloak: The Spectre can warp light around itself to hide from enemy sight. The shimmering can be detected from up close though.
Rapid Slice: The Spectre goes into a slashing frenzy, destroying any infantry within its reach.


ScorpionsThe Sai may not be as technologically advanced as the Echelon but that doesn’t mean they don’t have machines. Scorpions are off-road vehicles used to patrol the wastes around Sai villages and to provide light strike power for when Sai forces go into combat. The Rangers enlisted to drive them revel in the freedom of thrashing their machine around and firing off the back mounted machine gun.

Sting: A ceramic shell-filled with Brood acid charged with Sai energy. On impact it does minimal damage, but greatly reduces the armour where the shell hit.

You are Painkiller, a mercenary for hire, charged with cleaning out nests of the undead. But an unholy pact with a demon unknowingly puts you square in the middle of a fight for control of the underworld... with the future of humanity hanging in the balance.

Intense gameplay: The player will be constantly outnumbered, fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds. 
Next-generation graphics: The game uses a proprietary 3D engine capable of pumping out 100X the polygons of some of the latest shooters, while adding increased texture quality and the latest lighting and shadowing techniques. 
Lasting replay value: Painkiller features a standard single player campaign, with additional modes to encourage replay. The game also features full multiplayer support.
Combo weapons: All weapons come in pairs, with a primary and secondary fire.
Morphing: Your unholy pact gives you the power to morph into a powerful possessed creature with every 100 souls collected.
Monster AI: Advanced AI coding will simulate group behaviours. Monsters don't spawn onto the map, they patrol. They are constantly aware of the player, and will coordinate their attacks by retreating, regrouping and counterattacking.
Physics Engine: Painkiller employs the Havok physics engine, allowing for inverse kinematics (""rag-doll physics"") and deformable, interactive environments

The Raoh story  arc has been completely reimagined, while the Celestial Emperor and Land  of Shura story arcs have been added as well. Whether you are familiar  with the source material or not, the story is more complete and more  enjoyable than ever before. By playing as different characters throughout each episode of the  story, you will be fully immersed in the Fist of the North Star world.  With features like boss battles faithfully recreating scenes from the  manga, series fans have plenty to be excited about.
In addition to a more faithful recreation of the story, a large number  of characters are added to the game series as well. In addition to the  playable characters from the previous game, those that appeared only as  NPCs such as Juza and Shew are now playable. In total, there will be  more than twice as many playable characters as the previous title. Popular characters from the new storylines such as Falco and Kaioh  will also appear, making for an even greater variety of characters to  control.
The ability of the successors of Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Seiken to kill  opponents in a single blow has been merged with Warriors-style  gameplay. This time, there will be even more exhilarating action than ever  before. In addition to the various techniques, taunts and special moves  of the previous game, new moves such as dodges and dashes will be added  as well. Experience life as a martial arts master as you predict an  enemy's attack and close the distance to finish him off before he can  even land a single punch.
The popular Dream Mode featuring original stories based on the characters has been completely revamped. Focused on the original manga, these stories will fill in the  gaps around the stages of the Legend Mode. Even characters that did not  get much coverage in the original manga will be given their time in the  spotlight, allowing you to enjoy plenty of hypothetical stories unique  to Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage 2.
This title features online co-op and versus play within Dream Mode. In versus play, players form teams and compete against the  other in a variety of missions, with the winners obtaining unique  bonuses. The character costume DLC that was so popular in the first game  also returns, and there are plans to make new stages available for  download in Dream Mode as well.  We are planning even more exciting things in regards to the online  features, so please stay tuned for more information as it becomes  available.

Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

Sometimes, Evil Wins
In Tyranny, the grand war between good and evil is over – and the forces of evil, led by Kyros the Overlord, have won. The Overlord’s merciless armies dominate the face of the world, and its denizens must find their new roles within the war-torn realm... even as discord begins to rumble among the ranks of Kyros’ most powerful Archons.   Players will experience the new world order under the Overlord in a reactive role-playing game (RPG), interacting with the populace as a powerful Fatebinder in the Overlord’s forces -- roaming the lands to inspire loyalty or fear as they bring control to the last holdouts of the Tiers.
Main Features

Branching, unique stories in an original setting: The battle between good and evil has already taken place, and evil stands victorious.  Choices matter – make world-altering decisions with far-reaching consequence: As a Fatebinder in the Overlord’s army you wield a vast amount of power in the occupied lands of the Tiers. Will you use that to inspire stability and loyalty, will you be feared, or will you seek your own power?  Challenging, classic RPG combat: Tactical real-time-with-pause combat with new party-driven mechanics and modern presentation.  A rich original setting: Not just another “hero’s journey” -- Tyranny turns the archetypal RPG story on its head and allows players to explore a new take on good and evil.

You can establish your club as the small team who receives loan players from a larger club or a large club looking for support getting your youngsters match experience by loaning them out. Have the first option on players from clubs, and schedule pre-arranged friendlies each season by simply asking your board for a feeder relationship and choose from the list they compile. Youth Revamp - A complete revamp of youth teams sees full youth squads for each team that has a youth set-up, thus giving a much better system for the regeneration of players in the long term game. Football Manager 2007 gives players a new easier to use default skin, along with hints and tips throughout the game, and an improved tutorial. In addition to better feedback from your assistant manager and scouts as well as lots more media, customisation and multiple row selection, all this adds up to the most user friendly Sports Interactive game ever. A complete revamp of the scouting system inside the game leads to more information about players and teams being made available to managers, as well as a more realistic methodology for player scouting. This system allows scouts to grow and improve their knowledge-base of the world's football players. You can now talk to any player in the world via the media. Player interaction allows you to tap up other teams stars or see if players will buckle under the pressure. An effective manager must use the media as a motivational tool - why not praise your own players in many different ways or shout at them for loss of form? For more varied ways to talk to your team, SI have worked hard to deliver vastly improved team talks at half and full time. Not only this, but pre-match team talks will now be making their first appearance in Football Manager - so you can send your team out onto the pitch with a specific briefing.

He is found and adopted. As he grows, he learns of his true identity and destiny of greatness.Thus is the premise of two of the greatest stories of our time, but that is where the similarities end.

Keep the match flowing with new off-load passing and quick set plays and get as close as you can get to the mud, sweat and tears of the real thing with faster, more realistic and responsive gameplay.

Drive your team to victory with effective use of your impact players whose innovation, inspiration and discipline can mean the difference between a humiliating defeat and a spectacular win.

When the pressure is really on and the game is on the line, resort to tough tactics to neutralise your opposition’s impact players. Used at the right time, laying a high hit on an opponent can turn the game in your favour. But remember, it’s just as likely to hand the advantage to your rivals – and land your player in the dreaded sin bin.

With authentic teams and players, more expansive gameplay and all-new hard-hitting action, EA SPORTS™ Rugby 06 lays bare the heart and soul of the greatest game on earth.   "

This Is the Police is a strategy/adventure game set in a city spiraling the drain. You’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg as gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd (portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem).
Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigues. You are taking the role of Police Chief Jack Boyd – you’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack see his retirement with a nice sum of money waiting to be spend or will he end up broken … or even worse?
Immerse yourself in a controversial tale of corruption, crime, and political intrigue. Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.
Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg? Or will you land yourself behind bars — or worse?











Your mission is clear: Make 500.000$ in 180 days, before Jack Boyd goes to retirement. How? Up to you!
Decisions, decisions, decisions – This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, it will influence your game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.
The Good, the Bad … the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg’s Police Department is dealing with all kind of people. It is up to you, to sort out the bad boys.
Follow your duties: As head of Freeburg PD, Jack has to take care of the daily routine – responding to emergencies, managing his officers, fighting for budget …
Start and solve Investigations and get evidence against the criminal gangs in Freeburg.
Deal with the different powers of the city: The Mayor, the Mafia, the Church, the Labor Union: everyone offers you a favor, but everything has its price …
Rich and fully voice acted story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by the glorious Jon St. John (aka the voice of Duke Nukem)

Worms is a cleverly-balanced turn-based strategy game in which teams of worms battle across bizarre randomly-generated landscapes for supremacy.
Each team takes it in turns to pick off the opposing teams using crazy weapons, tools and other utilities and whatever foul strategies they can devise.
Worms die when they lose all of their energy or plunge into the water. The winning team is the one that manages to survive the mayhem and have worms left standing when the dust settles. Sound simple? Easy to play but difficult to master, it’s a game of deep strategy that belies its simple appearance.




A cleverly balanced mix of strategy and arcade action that while simple and easy to understand, contains real depth and massive replay-ability
Offline turn-based play for up to 4 players
Online turn-based play for up to 4 players over Live
An assortment of game options, from the landscape on which to battle on, to turn time, round time, and the starting weapon arsenal of each team. 
3 detailed tutorials to introduce the mechanics to those who’ve not played the game before
20 increasingly difficult single player challenges
3 graphical themes on which to play
A random landscape generator meaning no two landscapes generated are ever the same
22 weapons and utilities to deploy against your enemies
A large amount of customization: from worm and team names, to what they say and gravestone they leave behind when they die.

By fashioning your own beats to the game’s library of songs, you’ll earn metal power that can be turned against the aliens.
•Jam Your WayA new spin on traditional music gameplay, Gal Metal eschews predetermined musical notes and lets the player create their own drumlines based on over a dozen beats. Practice the beats in your club room after school and wrack up unique combos to blow the aliens away in live performances.
•Unique StorytellingDivided up into episodes ending in climactic concerts, the lighthearted story of Gal Metal unfolds in animated manga panels and text messages brimming with personality. The manga reads right-to-left for an authentically Japanese experience.
•Be an After-School SpecialistIn between performances to take on the pesky aliens, you’ll manage your own life as a student. Improve your skills and friendships by doing part-time jobs, hanging out with your friends, and jamming in the club room.
•Show Your True MettleWhile the basic gameplay of Gal Metal is simple to learn, players who master the beats can earn millions of points by creating complex performances. How much metal power can you score?

THE FIRST ACTION-RPG in the world of Warhammer 40,000
Set in the dystopian 41st millennium, Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr places the Inquisitors of the grim future into an Action-RPG and pits them against heretics, mutants, treacherous xenos and the daemons of the Chaos Gods.
Your mission is to purge the unclean and protect the Imperium from corruption!
 
BECOME AN INQUISITOR
INQUISITORS ARE POWERFUL SECRET AGENTS
Inquisitors are the fearsome and legendary secret agents of the Imperium with a wide range of unique skills, huge influence and deadly firepower. They come from diverse backgrounds and they specialize in different areas.
THEIR TASK IS DAUNTING, THEIR VIGIL IS ENDLESS.
EXPANDING THE BOUNDARIES
THE NEXT MILESTONE IN THE EVOLUTION OF ACTION-RPGS
Inquisitor – Martyr is an open-world sandbox Action-RPG set in the Caligari Sector, a secluded region of the Imperium with hundreds of star systems, thousands of planets, which offers a huge variety of mission types on randomly generated maps: a persistent universe with special mini-campaigns and a storyline influenced by the community.
THERE IS ONLY WAR
A MONUMENTAL AND BRUTAL EXPERIENCE
True to the spirit of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, the gameplay incorporates tactical elements like the cover-based combat, a brand new AI and controllable vehicles, not to mention the spectacular display of destruction where attacks noticeably affect the environment.
BLOOD AND GORE
BRUTAL FIGHTS WITH A TACTICAL LAYER
Battles are not only vicious and bloody, but the more challenging fights just got some extra flavor.
Aimed attacks at giant foes can destroy body parts, getting rid of the special abilities, not to mention the rewarding and special execution moves to finish off the bosses.
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS
COMMUNITY-BASED GAMEPLAY
In addition to the single-player Story Mode, the Inquisitorial Campaign not only introduces the cooperative gameplay up to 4 players, but gives you the chance to join various Inquisitorial clans.
Participate in unique World Events and go on unique chains of missions that could influence the fate of the whole sector.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

And so, together, they work to regain understanding between the humans and dragons, while investigating the evil at work behind the scenes.
As with the TV show, all the events in Dragon Booster for Nintendo DS take place in Dragon City, during the prelude to the Dragon/Human war.
There are two modes available. Adventure mode is mission-based, and puts you in the centre of the Libris Alliance Story. Challenge mode is where you get to explore Dragon City in search of dragons to collect, train, and breed for racing. You can own a maximum of 12 dragons, but can trade with friends via the Nintendo DS wireless link to get the ones you want.

When the dwarven mining expedition discovered an ancient temple dedicated to an unnamed deity - all of the world's most powerful factions saw it as a possible clue to the place of Azriaal's burial ground. A silent war has now begun and it will soon ignite the fires that will lead to the holy crusade of the Orcs. However, the real danger lies somewhere else. A powerful force churns silently - weaving a secret plot of fear and destruction. In the end one of the Two Worlds will remain. It is up to you to save the world...or destroy it!

This enigmatic organization plans to unleash a lethal computer virus that can disable any computer in the world. One false step, however, and the secretary will disavow any knowledge ... you know the drill.Features 

Third-person adventure with emphasis on stealth 
Choose different paths to complete your objectives 
Emphasis on the details. Carry a decommissioned guard to a door and use his hand to activate a biometric ID reader 
Highly detailed environments and characters put you right in the game. 

In Operation Surma, you won't stumble across an unholy arsenal of cutting-edge weapons to blast your enemies to high heaven. Noise draws unwanted attention to your efforts. Ethan instead prefers silent-but-deadly stealth. Big guns aren't really needed, because Ethan can silently and swiftly disptach a man with his bare hands.Where Operation Surma lacks in weapons it makes up in gadgets second only to those of that 00 guy from England. The gadget players will use the most is the Electronic Lock Pick, which allows you to hack into the Surma security systems. Set off an alarm? No problem, hack into the nearest alarm disabler. This gives the all-clear that the intruder has been captured. There's nothing like giving the hapless guards a false sense of security to give you more confidence.Ethan's IMF contact lenses display a level map at the screen's bottom left and give Ethan night-vision capabilities to see electronic alarm tripwires and other traps that lie concealed lurk in the gloom. The Electronic War Gun disables surveillance cameras and creates distractions to lure guards from their posts.All the gadgets in the world, however, can't help Ethan move undetected from shadow to shadow and take out Surma guards. That's your job. The shadows has different shades, making finding the darkest ones vital. With the help of a stealth meter and a 360-degree view, you hide Ethan in dark corners, then sneak out and surprise unsuspecting guards with quick strikes. You don't want to leave a body in plain view of a security camera, so you'll often need to dump the evidence in the shadows.Running and gunning is sometimes a good tactic, but don't overuse it. In an unusual twist, Ethan can try to get the upper hand against Surma by forming uneasy alliances with unsavory characters.IMF computer expert Luther Stickell (voiced by Ving Rhames) feeds objectives to Ethan and shows the next objective's location on the map. The interaction between Luther and Ethan can be a bit clunky at times (at one climactic moment, Luther sounds as excited as a wet rag), but Luther is one sharp computer whiz.Overall, the tale of espionage has more twists and turns than ten roller coasters. You get assassination, disguises, and more. Is there a mole in the team?The learning curve for the controls is a short.

Taught you the old ways and codes of the family; do what you gotta do, but protect the innocent and never let the cops get wise. His rise to the top brought about an unofficial truce amongst the bickering crime families. But someone has designs on ruining that peace. Someone killed rival Don Montagano's son – now he blames Don Coladangelo. Your mentor calls on your loyalty to thwart an attack on him by the Montaganos. It's now up to you to keep this little conflict from erupting into a full-scale street war.
Trigger Man puts you in the shoes of the underworld’s toughest mob enforcer. You’ll have to work fast; all you have are your wits, muscle and brute force.
Trigger Man features:

Eight mobster missions: In the name of the Coladangelo Family, engage in the destruction of rival gang operations, intimidation or assassination of witnesses and rival mob leaders, and wounding a “soldier” here and there as a message to his boss.  
Realistic locales: Search through deserted loading docks, duke it out in a fine Italian restaurant or scour a casino for your prey. There are many locations for your enemies to hide.  
Knife-cam: Use a special throwing knife to rub out your enemies silently from a distance. When you throw a knife, a first-person camera attaches to it and allows you to ""steer"" as it flies toward your victim.

Death awaits at every corner in Egypt, and only the most  audacious warriors will have any chance of success. The Pharaoh’s army  and countless dangerous creatures will stand in your way.
Pharaonic is an unforgiving sidescrolling Action-RPG set in Ancient Egypt. Explore a vast kingdom full of dangers and brutal enemies while you find the truth behind Ahmosis I, the Red Pharaoh.
Polish your combat skills to the finest and loot the best gear  possible to even have the slightest chance of overcoming this difficult  endeavor. Will you opt for lightweight equipment, trusting on your  agility to avoid death? Or will you prefer to take the blow and strike  back even harder? The decision is entirely yours to make.
Throughout your path you will find help from the Daughters of Ishtar,  as well as the oppresed countrymen. Learn new skills and subdue divine  powers to overcome your opponents. Drink from your life-water canteen to  heal your wounds, and acquire new equipment that will help you avoid  death one more day.

Revolutionary feature: Use the revolutionary Cross-Com, a communication device powered by satellite technology. Attached to the soldier's monocle, the Cross-Com provides full situational awareness and command of the battlefield. Command the Ghost squad and remote allied forces and drones, and direct artillery and air strikes. See what the squad sees and receive visual and auditory intelligence from allied forces and unmanned drones. 
Stunning urban environment: One capital, multiple locations. Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter takes place entirely in Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities. A stunning, meticulously detailed universe provides complete immersion in the urban war of the future.

The year is 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. With only        six years left until the mysterious crystalline structure Tiberium        renders the earth entirely uninhabitable, the two opposing factions –        Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod – inevitably        find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from        extinguishing mankind. The unthinkable becomes reality and Nod’s        enigmatic leader Kane takes off for GDI headquarters. What is Kane        planning in the heart of his enemies’ base? Command & Conquer 4 draws the epic conclusion to the beloved Tiberium universe, where fans        will learn the fate of Earth, Nod, Tiberium, GDI and most importantly,        Kane’s motivations behind his decade-long plan.
In addition to the two campaigns on the epic battles of GDI and Nod,        which players will get to conquer alone or in a cooperative mode, Command        & Conquer 4 will also feature a new 5v5 objective-based        multiplayer mode, promoting teamwork and cooperation and delivering a        social real-time-strategy experience never seen before in a Command &        Conquer game.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

High-speed races on powerful bikes alternate with motocross on more nimble machines for a white-knuckle ride that remains playable despite the need for technical prowess, with rules of fair-play often put to one side. Moto Racer 4, which is still developed by Microïds and Artefacts Studio, under the supervision of its original designer, Paul Cuisset, will include no less than 15 single and multiplayer game modes. In addition to regular fixtures such as the Time Trial, Single Race and Championship, here are a few examples of what to expect:
- KING OF THE HILL: Each rider starts with the same time on the clock. While time runs down for the leader, the other racers get extra turbo. The first player to get their counter down to zero wins the race.
- LAST MAN STANDING: The last player to pass each checkpoint is eliminated.
- SURVIVAL: The race starts with very little time on the clock. Players gain time by passing the checkpoints. In single-player mode, the aim is to survive for a specific length of time. In multi-player mode, the winner is the last player with time left on their clock.
- CATCH-UP: The player's opponents begin the race with a headstart and the player must be in first place at a specific time.
- WOLF PACK: The player begins the race with a headstart and must maintain it for a certain length of time without being overtaken.
- GHOST BIKE: The player starts the race in last place and is not allowed to deviate from the road or collide with others. S/he must finish in a specified minimum place.
- GOLDEN HELMET: Competitors must earn the one golden helmet up for grabs during therace. To do this, they must be first past the initial checkpoint. If the player wearing the golden helmet is knocked by another player, s/he surrenders it to that player. If a player falls off their bike, s/he loses the helmet and it is automatically sent to the next checkpoint.

Brawlout is the party fighting game, designed for couch play, online matches and competitive tournaments.









Streamlined combat

Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.By focusing on aggressive mechanics, new players will be able to easily nail impressive combos while not feeling overwhelmed by friends who’ve had a bit more practice. Ideal for beginners as well as pro gamers looking to dedicate the time to participate in the many tournaments we have planned throughout the year.







Action is kept fast and fluid

Advanced techniques like air dodging, wavedashes, directional influence, teching, ledge grabs or Rage Bursts.









Vastly different combat styles

Each character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.







Rage Meter

The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.









Single Player Modes

AI opponents are available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all:

Train with Advanced Tutorials
Practice advanced combo setups with custom settings and helpful visual aids
Climb the challenging Arcade Towers.








Multiplayer Game Modes

Up to four players can compete in either timed, stock or team battles:

All on the same device
Each with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby (Nintendo Switch only)
Go online to challenge players worldwide or create custom lobbies just for your friends, with custom game rules

The player alternately assumes the roles of two distinct, antagonistic characters: a sneaking fugitive Billy and his hunter the reverend Ray.

The game features fast paced revolver duels using historically accurate firearms, horseback riding, mounted combat and stealth actions in memorable locations set after Western movies. Emergent gameplay based on accurate simulation of not only rigid bodies and rag-dolls but also liquids, gases, fire and smoke makes the gameplay innovative and non-linear. "

In his battle against conspiracy and rebellion, he recruits five specialists in assassination, sabotage and espionage.
The team must fight against the mysterious Kage-sama, who plans to overthrow the Shogun. They infiltrate castles, gather information through espionage, fight rebellions and ruthlessly eliminate Kage-sama’s allies. The group is comprised of very different personalities; working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will face some kind of personal drama.
 
Command a team of ninjas in a game where stealth is everything and being spotted by the enemy means almost certain death.
Skillfully hide from and sneak past the enemies fields of view, take their formations apart and hide their bodies to cover your tracks. Quick Save will enable you to execute your plans perfectly. Tactically plan actions for your whole team and execute them all at once. Make use of the vertical gameplay and jump from roof to roof to silently kill your foes from above.
Play it your way: Dozens of solutions to take enemy setups apart, you can creatively use all of your resources – characters, skills and environment – to outsmart, sneak past, kill or knock out enemies
Small team vs. large enemy force: Control a team of five specialists, including a ninja, a samurai and a geisha, and take on an overwhelming opposition.
Careful planning, fast execution: Observe the enemy and plan your approach, because when it’s time to act, you must be quick, precise and undetected.

An abandoned farmhouse becomes your new home, and  the fields your new responsibility. Plant crops in the spring and reap  the rewards before winter comes and covers the land in snow. Trade crops  for animals, raise and breed them, and use their unique abilities to  hunt wild animals and defend your farm.
In Shepherd's Crossing for the PSP it’s up to you to  run your own farm and make it thrive.  The game is all about the  sheep.  In fact, the main source of income is based on high-quality wool  products.  Turn your small, empty farm into a successful sheep colony  in order to complete the game’s main story, but the game doesn’t end  there.  After the story you can continue to build, customize and grow  your farm, so the fun never stops.
Though you begin with just a small plot of land, a sickle, and some  grass and pasture to tend to, you can grow this grass and trade it in  the village for new items for your farm such as crops or animals.   Growing these new crops or raising and breeding the animals will give  you additional items that can be traded for even more new crops or  animals.  It is this growing and trading system that will allow you to  expand your farm and turn it into a thriving business.  The townsfolk  will be there not only to trade with you but also to offer advice and  help.  Throughout the game they will introduce you to new animals, make  you meals from your crops, give you gifts if they like you, and  occasionally even share some know-how or new farming techniques
 
Key Features:

 Plant seeds, and grow crops to build a thriving farm.
Raise a wide variety of animals, including 12 breeds of dog.
Trade your way up a complex chain of products to become a master farmer.
Hunt wild animals to defend your farm and collect resources.
Unlock special items, and earn trophies for exceptional skill.

The Town of Light
12 March 1938. Renée, 16 years old, is ripped out of her world, locked up and deprived of everything. Her only fault was that she didn't know what her place in the world was. ""A danger to herself and others and a cause of public scandal"" wrote the police headquarters. The only horror you will find in this game is the truth: a blow to the solar plexus, much more intense than any supernatural presence
The Town of Light is a psychological adventure told in the first person. The story is set in Italy in the first half of the 20th Century in a place which really existed and has been meticulously reconstructed. Exploring and interacting with the environment you will relive the history of the main character through her confused viewpoint and on the basis of your choices, the story will develop in different ways.

Take the wheel of a flying car and don't be late for a second term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry™ in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets™! Based on J.K. Rowling's second book in the worldwide best-selling series, players face a magical multitude of new challenges and mysteries as the famous ""Boy Who Lived"" for the PlayStation® 2 computer entertainment system, Nintendo GameCube™, Xbox® video game system form Microsoft, PC, Game Boy™ Advance, PlayStation® and Game Boy® Color.   Ignoring Dobby™ the house-elf's grave warning that disaster will strike if he returns to Hogwarts, Harry embarks on his second year to find Dobby's predictions coming true! Harry soon finds himself entangled in a dark plot against his ""Mudblood"" classmates, as students keep turning up petrified! Could Draco Malfoy™ be to blame, or is something even more malevolent at work? With the help of returning friends Hermione, Ron, Hagrid™ and Hedwig™, players attend new classes to learn second-year spells that will aid them in a quest to uncover the true identity of the ""Heir of Slytherin"".  On the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, and PC, players enter fantastical free-roaming 3D environments from Harry's world.

Additionally, Harry can, of course, cast spells against foes – but these spells must be perfectly executed, or they could be miscast with humorous or critical consequences! Mini-games within levels can be revisited, so players can help Mrs. Weasley with ""de-gnoming"" her garden, challenge other students in Professor Lockhart's Dueling Club, or complete other mini-games again and again.   Harry returns to the PlayStation, to explore new interactive environments in an action/adventure quest to win the House Cup.

Interpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, incarcerate, make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure and strategy, set in a cold border town riven with violence. 
Welcome to Sharpwood, where people know their neighbors by name and faithfully keep to their traditions, no matter how barbaric those traditions might be. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. Despair grows like a cancer, hand in hand with violence. It’s a hell of a job for the new sheriff, Lilly Reed (voiced by Sarah Hamilton, of the celebrated adventure saga The Longest Journey). She’s struggling to maintain order and peace, while her subordinates are uncouth men who aren’t used to taking commands from a young woman. But everything changes when a mysterious stranger calling himself Warren Nash appears in Sharpwood. And no one knows what he'll bring to the town: salvation or perdition.
Just like the first game, This Is the Police 2 is a mixture of adventure and management genres, and this time it enjoys further unexpected mechanics that will strengthen both the strategic and tactical parts of the game. It won’t be enough just managing the equipment of your policemen and keeping in mind their individual skills. Every challenge requires the player’s direct participation, and the outcomes will depend on every decision you make. Now your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices, and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive.











Jump into a surprising mix of gameplay styles. Just like its predecessor, This Is the Police 2 draws on different genres and mechanics, merging them into a one-of-a-kind story driven experience – this time adding even more unexpected twists. Is it an adventure game? A strategy? A simulation? A management game? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!
Participate in a harsh story where no one is completely innocent. The people of Sharpwood are ignorant and cruel. Poverty and hunger are met with increased outbursts of domestic crime, all while the inaction of the authorities has the townspeople relying on “forest spirits” and archaic religious cults. Constant problems with the food supply have delivered the town into the hands of local smugglers, many of whom are former military. Accuse the innocent, make deals with criminals, torture the ones who won’t go along willingly – you can do whatever it takes to make things go your way












Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all these things in order to survive. The same goes for the rest of townspeople: in Sharpwood, everything’s built on personal relationships, and you never know when being friends with the local butcher or business associates with the morgue owner might save your life.

This is the game that Rail enthusiasts have been waiting for! Rail Simulator provides the most realistic simulation of trains possible on a PC. Plus we provide you, the player, with powerful tools to create your own railway world.
 The ability to add additional material to the simulation has been central in the design of the simulation. Rail Simulator allows easy inclusion of add-on material covering new routes, rolling stock and additional missions. We are currently working with third party developers and expect to have additional add-ons for the game available shortly after its release.
 
Of great importance to the more enthusiastic railway fan is the ability to create their own additional routes, so included with Rail Simulator is an editor that allows the creation of new environments. These tools have been developed with simplicity in mind, so as to encourage the development and exchange of user-generated content, which can be shared and used by other railway enthusiasts.

In an abyss of infinite chaos,
God created light.
God then created a Ptolemaic system around the planet Ceta as well as Lucifel.
However, when God sensed the presence of ego, the Metatron plan was introduced.
The plan was carried out by the righteous man, Enoch, and Ceta was destroyed.
After that, God created the  planet Ryuta within a Heliocentric system.This planet became what we now know as Earth.
Enoch, after fulfilling his duty, dispersed his remaining strength into 72 shards. As Lucifel fell into a deep sleep, he dreamt of wandering the Earth.
This story is about one of the shards that fell to Earth.

Tchoup can pick items and keep them in his pockets, and he’s a detective. His friend Stucco is not as good at the deductive reasoning (to be honest, he’s not good at all!) – but he is strong enough to do lifting and climbing. The third goblin, Perlius, is the one with the magic powers and a dark sense of humor.The games mix elements of adventure and puzzle gaming. In essence, the player must find the solution to each level, in order to progress to the next. An original aspect of the series is that the player usually controls multiple goblins as player characters, each of whom has a unique set of abilities (the number of letter i’s in the word ""Goblin"" of the title indicates the number of characters that the player may control). The player may only control one character at a time but, depending on the specific scene, may switch characters at will. "

“We have been monitoring feedback and comments on the progression of the PES series for some time now, and PES 2010 will see us implementing a great deal of the ideas players have been requesting,” said Naoya Hatsumi, Producer for PES Productions at Konami Digital Entertainment Japan. “We aim to make PES 2010 a more user-friendly, immediate experience that places the emphasis on getting straight into the gameplay for which the series is famed. PES 2010 will look better, will play better, and will recreate real football as closely as the current hardware will allow.”
Features:

Gameplay: ""PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that will constantly test the player. Intuitive zonal defending will cover spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real football simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches.""


Exclusive Europa League License: ""Konami has strengthened its relationship with UEFA and can announce it has secured the exclusive video game rights for the Europa League Licence (formerly known as the UEFA Cup). In addition Konami will be enhancing and developing the use of the UEFA Champions League within PES 2010 to make even better use of the best club football competition in the world.""

THE REAL FACE OF WAR. SEE IT FROM PERSPECTIVE OF CIVILIANS.
In This War of Mine for the first time you do not play as an elite soldier, but a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of necessities and constant danger.
HIDE DURING THE DAY. LEAVE ONLY WHEN NIGHT COVERS YOU.
During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive.
MAKE LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS. FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.

Boost your brain power with 3 GAMES-in-1!
Now you can boost your brain power with 3 full games on 1 cartridge! The        brain produces five wavelengths: alpha, beta, delta, gamma and theta        waves. Brain Boost Gamma Wave and Brain Boost Beta Wave are individual        games designed to develop the right brain by increasing your recognition        of images/shapes/spatial patterns, illustrations and intuition. In Mega        Brain Boost, you’ll get both of these previously released titles, plus a        third entirely new game! All three games utilize Makoto Shichida’s        “right brain development theory” to train your brain.
 

 Get three full brain games on 1 game cartridge!
 
 

 Brain Boost Beta Wave includes five different types of progressively          difficult brain training games where speed and accuracy count: Find          the Match, Shape Recognition, Addition, Remember Sequence and Moving          Dots.
 

 Brain Boost Gamma Wave includes: Remember Colors, Remember Numbers,          Remember Circumstances, Remember Faces and Remember Images.
 

 Plus a third never-before-released third game on the same cartridge          that includes: Match the Kanji Characters, Dots, Colors, Find the Goal          and Total Amount of Money.
 

 Two game modes within each: Brain Training and Multiplayer.
 

 Each game type contains 4 difficulty levels with 20 multiple choice          problems in each.
 

 Receive your overall score for right brain development after          completing a brain training series.
 

 Play a friend in any of the 15 game types to see who’s the bigger          brainiac.
 

 Increase your level of difficulty by answering correctly. Answer          incorrectly and your difficulty level will decrease resulting in a          lower score percentage.

Save the world. Explore space. Venture into new dimensions.
 
The First True Action MMORPG

Hi-Octane Excitement: Champions Online delivers furious, fast-paced encounters previously reserved for action and fighting games. No more boring auto attacks and lengthy recharge times. Champions Online combat is instantaneous — and electrifying!
Brains required: Every enemy and super-powered threat in Champions Online has its own unique abilities and combat specialties. Use your head — or wind up dead!
Bring friends, make friends: The Champions Online universe will be jam-packed with thousands of heroes, facing thousands of threats. Join up with other heroes, create your own superteam, and prepare to take on the ultimate threats!

Be a Champion.

Total customization, at your fingertips: Choose from hundreds of different costume pieces, colors and body types to create your character's one-of-a-kind costume and look. There are billions of possible combinations, and in a universe brimming with the fantastic and the unforgettable, you can still be completely unique! 
Your powers, on your terms: There are a multitude of astonishing powers to choose from in Champions Online, and its flexible character creation system gives you total control over your hero's abilities. You can even pick the appearance of your powers. Do you want purple force fields? Green fire blasts? Jet black claws? In Champions Online, you decide! 
Keep your enemies close: Every hero must have an archenemy. In Champions Online, you design your character's supreme adversary, choosing a name, powers and costume for a superpowered foe to bedevil your hero throughout his or her career. 
Bigger and better: Vanquish evil, and your successes will be rewarded with costume pieces to enhance your powers and abilities. Then customize the appearance of those rewards to your vision of your hero's look and abilities!

Vast Universe

Endless exploration: The battle against evil in Champions Online rages across the world into outer space and alternate dimensions. No other MMOG offers players the chance to explore such diverse realms — from the shining skyscrapers of Millennium City and the frozen wastes of Canada to the interstellar gladiatorial arena on the moon, the hidden underwater city of Lemuria and the foul mystical dimension known as Qliphotic. 
Evil most foul: Battle supervillains, aliens, giant monsters and secret, sinister organizations. Doctor Destroyer is launching new plans to conquer the world. VIPER lurks in the shadows, seeking chances to strike at humanity. The ancient Lemurians are plotting a return to power. And Mechanon won't stop until it has wiped all organic life from the planet. Can you stop these heinous threats to humanity?
Make your mark: The story of Champions Online is constantly changing, continually evolving. Villains are defeated. Heroes rise and fall. Cities transform. Your actions may decide the future!

These extra weapons are left around the courses, and must be gathered before your opponents get them.

Torment continues the thematic legacy of Planescape: Torment,  the critically acclaimed role-playing game from 1999 that's considered  by many to be a hallmark for storytelling in computer RPGs. With  Torment, we're creating a rich role-playing experience that explores  similar deep personal themes using the following ""Four Pillars"" design:

A Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The  philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically  and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary  weapons.
A World Unlike Any Other. The game has a  fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals,  imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic.  In Numenera, however, “magic” is actually something surprisingly  different.
A Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is  thoughtful and character-driven—epic in feel but a deeply personal  narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their  own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.
Reactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The  game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make  a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and  discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won't tell you how to  play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from  your actions throughout the game.

Leaving the Mediterranean behind, the city-building series makes its first foray into the Orient and immerses the player in brand new surroundings.

This is the world in which the player will take the reigns of leadership and take their cities through the twists and turns of Chinese history.

Beautiful surroundings. A flock of pheasants with brilliantly colored feathers flies away in fear of the hunter's sharp arrows. Buddhist monks leave their strikingly beautiful pagodas to enlighten the city's residents. Entertainers in richly decorated costumes march down the street to celebrate the New Year. These are but a few of the sights upon which the player will feast his eyes in Emperor.
For the first time, multiplayer gameplay. Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom offers gamers their first opportunity to play a city building game with their friends, online via the Internet. A great variety of both collaborative and competitive multiplay games will be offered. Players may need to collaborate in building one of China's engineering marvels, or there may be a common goal for all cities to attain a certain affluence. In competitive multiplay, players take sides – or may be a side unto themselves – and fight for sole power over China.
Familiar concepts, ancient beliefs. Both the Chinese zodiac and the concept of Feng Shui play a role in Emperor. Players choose an animal to represent themselves while they play, and receive benefits based on that animal's role in the Chinese zodiac. In addition, the concept of Feng Shui, the harmonious arrangement of objects in relation to their environment, must be taken into consideration when designing cities. The player achieves a high level of Feng Shui when his city is designed efficiently and when people are surrounded by beautiful structures.
Changing times. As the player progresses through time in Emperor, many of the goods and resources he depends on in one era are replaced by better resources in the next era. As advancements are discovered, efficiency increases. For example, a soldier armed with a steel sword is much more powerful than one armed with a bronze weapon, and paper money can be printed faster than metal coins can be struck.
Monuments. In Emperor, the player can build many of the edifices for which China is well known, including The Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, the Hall of Light, and Su Sung's astronomical clock tower.
Diplomacy and trade. Players can employ emissaries to help establish trading relationships with other cities, or use spies to gather information that will help plan attacks on rivals.

To help novice players gain confidence, there is TENNIS MASTERS’ unique HELPER feature. A simple blue cursor, that can be switched on or off, aids you to see the best position to be in to successfully hit the ball returned from your opponent.
Two challenging modes of play are available, Exhibition Mode - play singles or doubles against a range of opponents in different locations, and Tournament Mode - enter a series of competitions around the world starting with Montreal, Santiago, New York and London, unlocking more locations as you win more tournaments. 
To complete the TENNIS MASTERS experience, choose a character at the beginning of play that you think will aid your progress in the game - each character has different attributes like, speed around the court, quality of serve and volley play.

The game is inspired by popular pulp fiction stories set during World War II, and delves into the key events and characters behind historic battles. Its scenario tells of a shady third party pulling the strings to orchestrate the war, using futuristic technology to advance the carnage for their own ends.  Players compete in both turn based and also real time strategy battles, plotting moves and attacks in the turn based section and getting hands on by switching to the real time combat mode where they’ll be in charge of firing and reloading the weapons. The emphasis is not on trying to blast everything that moves however, as the player will often leave their vessels exposed and in significant danger.  Keeping the right ships afloat is key, as the player will need certain craft to enable to them gain new bases and increase their fleet and others, like Submarines, to take out the heavyweight attack carriers of your enemy.  As you would expect with a game of this nature, it’s perfect for two-player action and the wireless connections of both machines enables friends to compete against each other. With 20 single player missions to take on and the option to customise the player’s own flagship, there’s plenty to get stuck into.

Buggy mode is very specific to V-Rally 4. You will need more than just your driving skills to come out on top. There are different routes through the off-road tracks: it's up to you to find the shortest path to victory. In addition to being a good driver, you also need to be clever!
V-Rallycross
If any one word can suffice to define V-Rallycross, it's ""spectacular"". For years it was the refuge of group B monsters, cars so powerful that FIA banished them from the world rally championship. A few visionaries then had the idea to race these vehicles on tracks that are less than one kilometre long, making for wild competitions.
Hillclimb
In Hillclimb, the course gains altitude. Your driving skills at the wheel of phenomenally powerful cars are put to a severe test over long and winding tracks. Hillclimbs are doubtless one of the most dangerous and demanding disciplines in motor sport.
Extreme-Khana
Extreme-Khana is a combination of several disciplines: drifting, rallycross (with respect to the rather untamed cars), and time attack. Added to all that is a dash of the drivers' genius and creativity. Extreme-Khana is one of the most incredible motor sports on the planet.
Rally
Rally is a unique sport, comprised of several timed stages, called ""specials"". The teams reconnoitre these sectors, compiling notes about them. This valuable information enables the co-driver to tell the driver what lies ahead.

As dangers and enemies close down on you, always  more fearsome and terrifying, you will be tempted to yield a bit more of  your soul to the demon that possesses you in order to gain more power…  and as the demon gains more of your soul, your physical transformation  becomes more obvious.

Before you do anything else, download the game and play the tutorial. It’s fun, it’s free, and it’ll teach you the foundations of Heroes of the Storm better than any webpage ever could. But once you’re done, come back and learn about all the things the tutorial doesn’t cover.
Things You Should Know After Playing the Tutorial

Movement: Getting your hero from A to B should be second nature.
Abilities: Slinging spells and using skills, easy as pie.
Combat: Health bars, attacking enemies, healing, and when to tuck tail and run.
Death: It’s just a flesh wound!
Minions: Enthusiastic, single-minded, team-oriented. Also, great cannon fodder.
Forts: Hurt like hell; make sure you have some minions with you.
Leveling: Gather XP, level up, become stronger.
Mercenaries: Defeat them at their camp to gain their service.
Cores: You lose your core, you lose the game.
Hearthstone: Press “B” to teleport back to your base. (Cards? What cards?)
Mount Up: Press “Z” to summon your mount and move faster.

Those are the basics of Heroes of the Storm. Enough to play and have fun, but a far cry from complete mastery of the game. What’s that? You’d like to master the Storm? Well, we can certainly assist you with that. Like we said: we’re here to help

収録ゲームその 2　エクスジール攻撃方法、攻略方法、稼ぎシステムなどが、選択する機体 (全 4 機体) によって大きく異なる、システム重視なフルスペックシューティングゲーム。当作は近年の縦スクロール型シューティングゲームには珍しい、当たり判定の付いた「地形」が存在するのが特徴。Xbox 360 版では、「画質や処理スピードの向上」「プレイアビリティ向上」は勿論、「連射対応」「Xbox LIVE による機体別ランキング」「2P 側機体でのプレイ」「リプレイ保存」など至れり尽くせりな機能が多数実装されている。

収録ゲームその 3　トライジールRemix2004 年にゲームセンターに登場した「トライジール」のアレンジ移植。「シ ンプルかつストレート」なスタイルのシューティングゲームと謳いつつも「1P 2P での機体性能差/隠し機体/隠しキャラクター & 隠しボーナス/ルート分岐」などの、多数のやり込み要素に加え、プレイヤーサイドから編み出された「ダダダ撃ち」「レレレ撃ち」「画面左下ボンバー」と いったゲームを有利に進めるための「ネタ」「テクニック」の存在も相まって、シンプルに見えて実態はかなり奥深い内容となっている。

収録ゲームその 4　-0 (マイナスゼロ) Xbox 360 用ソフト「シューティング ラブ。200X」のために製作された、トライアングル・サービスの完全新作シューティングゲーム。固 定画面上に大量発生する敵キャラ、敵弾をロックオンショットのみで破壊する。単純明快なシステムに加え「破壊衝動」「爽快感」「中毒性」を徹底追求したよ うなゲームデザインゆえ、発売後「-0患者」が多数出現しそうな予感。 当然、Xbox LIVE によるスコア争いも熾烈になりそうだ。なお当作の BGM は超有名シューティングゲームコンポーザーが担当しているという噂だ。

実績について『実績』については「実績の達人」もビックリなシュールで斬新、およそ常人 (失礼！) には考えも及ばないような解除ネタからお約束系ネタまで「シューティング ラブ。200X」収録全タイトルに満遍なく入っている模様。全員期待しておくべし!!

同梱特典　ナイスDVD 2！DVD収録容量限界 (約4時間) たっぷり「シューティング ラブ。」な内容の攻略 DVD がソフトパッケージに同梱される。『エ クスジール』全 4 機体のハイスコア映像 (解説テロップ付き) 、及び『シューティング技能検定』のスーパープレイ映像、2007 年下半期に開催された業務用シューティングゲーム初の全国大会 『シューティング ラブ。甲子園』のハイライトから藤野社長製作の連射測定ミニゲーム『射ウォッチ』の衝撃的記録映像までをも収録し、更に各コンテンツの副音声ではゲーム製 作者の藤野社長と各プレイヤーによるオーディオコメンタリーが再生可能。

Keith Chegwin rose to fame back in the mid 1970s, when at the tender age of 17, he secured a role as a presenter on Multicoloured Swap Shop, which ran from 1976 to 1982, making a household name of the Merseyside lad we’ve all come to know and love.
With over 7,000 TV shows as a presenter under his belt – most famously, Cheggers Plays Pop - and a myriad guest appearances in the nation’s most popular television programmes, Keith Chegwin has also fronted his own radio shows, written regular newspaper columns and made several records! The fact that there are very few Britons that have never heard of him is testament not only to his popularity, which is due in no small part to his infectious charm, but also to the fact that he remains one of the UK’s hardest working stars.
Spanning more than three decades, Cheggers’ career has seen more than a few ups and downs but he has always bounced back with renewed vim and maintained his position in the very hearts of the UK’s TV viewing public. Now he adds another feather in his cap as the presenter of Oxygen Games’ new quiz title; Cheggers’ Party Quiz, enthusing;
“This is such a fantastic project - I'm so excited by it! I have been very impressed by Oxygen Games, because of their enthusiasm for this project and I hope that everyone who plays the game thinks it is great fun.”

Two new cover stars will grace the packshot with multiple player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo and England star Michael Owen endorsing the quality of PES 2008 by deciding to use their considerable talents alongside that of the game. As well as the outside having a new look, fans will be eager to know what new changes can be found inside the most important area of PES 2008 – the gameplay.  PES 2008 will feature a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It will learn counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use.  Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers will hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates will make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built.

This Xbox 360 exclusive will take the frantic one-on-one fighting game series in an exciting new direction as an intense tactical action game. 
“Guilty Gear 2: Overture retains a lot of elements that fighting games are known for, so it’s cool to see how familiar moves like the Gun Flame make the transition to 3D,” said Michael Manzanares, Project Lead, Aksys Games. “Only now, you’re facing off against an entire army instead of just one character. You’ll lose (badly) if you think you’re a one-man army, so you definitely have to remember that you have your own army to command.”
Guilty Gear 2: Overture Prologue
In the far future, humanity succeeded in developing an endless energy called the ‘Divine Power’. But, although they were able to obtain wisdom, mankind could not cast aside their foolishness. Tension among the major powers led to the creation of biological weapons that were based on that power – Gears. 
Justice, the only Gear able to command the legions of biological weapons, went berserk and declared war on all of humanity. That was the beginning of the worst war in history – The Crusades.
In response, mankind formed an order of elite knights, and with their participation, Justice was defeated. With her fall, all Gears ceased to function and entered a dormant state. The long-lasted Crusades came to an end, and it seemed like peace had been restored.
However, true history has yet to reveal itself…

Buggy mode is very specific to V-Rally 4. You will need more than just your driving skills to come out on top. There are different routes through the off-road tracks: it's up to you to find the shortest path to victory. In addition to being a good driver, you also need to be clever!
V-Rallycross
If any one word can suffice to define V-Rallycross, it's ""spectacular"". For years it was the refuge of group B monsters, cars so powerful that FIA banished them from the world rally championship. A few visionaries then had the idea to race these vehicles on tracks that are less than one kilometre long, making for wild competitions.
Hillclimb
In Hillclimb, the course gains altitude. Your driving skills at the wheel of phenomenally powerful cars are put to a severe test over long and winding tracks. Hillclimbs are doubtless one of the most dangerous and demanding disciplines in motor sport.
Extreme-Khana
Extreme-Khana is a combination of several disciplines: drifting, rallycross (with respect to the rather untamed cars), and time attack. Added to all that is a dash of the drivers' genius and creativity. Extreme-Khana is one of the most incredible motor sports on the planet.
Rally
Rally is a unique sport, comprised of several timed stages, called ""specials"". The teams reconnoitre these sectors, compiling notes about them. This valuable information enables the co-driver to tell the driver what lies ahead.

Transfer Center - A new way of managing all current transfer and loan bids for your club, both incoming and outgoing, making it easier to compare bids and reject or accept them.  Finance Revamp - Sports Interactive have updated the finance area of Football Manager 2008 to better reflect the ever-changing modern football world. More information is available to the manager too, including, but not limited to, corporate matchday income, season ticket news, investment funds, improved sponsorships, collective win bonuses and the ability to move around funds from the wage budget and transfer budget (and vice versa) at any point to help you in your quest for the ideal squad.  International Management - The international management gameplay has been completely revamped for Football Manager 2008, including, but not limited to, media improvements, international retirements, player interaction, international scouting, improved national pool selection, captain selection and a separation of international and club morale for players.  Match Flow - The largest change to matchdays in a Sports Interactive game since the introduction of the 2D match engine. Match flow brings more atmosphere to matchdays with match previews, team talks, opposition player instructions, the match itself, half time and post match now seamlessly following on from one another. There's no more pausing to make tactical changes and you'll find a mini-radar pitch whilst making those tactical changes to keep you in touch with what's going on in the match.  Confidence - You can now easily tell what your board and supporters think about your performance in the game through the new confidence section. This gives you feedback not just on your current progress in competitions, but also your financial management and signings.  Easier to Use - A much cleaner skin, a brand new advisor system to help you through various areas of the game, a new notes and notebook system, better button positioning for simpler navigation and an updated tutorial and manual. Also, coach reports to make taking over a new team easier and a new calendar system - which lists all important dates throughout the season - help to make Football Manager 2008 the easiest Sports Interactive game to use yet.  Fan Days - The board can now arrange fan days to boost ailing attendances, or for matches that are likely to attract a low crowd, with a long-term affect to attendances if all goes well.   Awards Overhaul - A full overhaul of the awards system inside the game, which is not only more accurate but also includes new awards, such as the European golden boot and a 'best eleven', which shows the all-time (in-game) best XI for all teams and nations.  Match Engine Improvements - A greatly improved match engine, once again utilizing the footballing brain of Ray Houghton and other tools used by real-life managers, to make the most accurate simulation of football in a computer game even more like-life than ever before. Oh, and the ability to change the pitch dimensions at the start of the season to suit your style of play better.  Expanded Media - More media and feedback than ever before, plus more detail in existing media, and a new competition news section to find out what major things are going on in all league competitions.  Regenerated Player Photos - All in-game regenerated players now have pictures using FaceGen technology to give each player more personality. This gives the ability for players to be seen to mature and grow-up looks-wise in front of your eyes as the game is going on.  Speedyfastier - Saving and loading is now significantly faster, with network gaming quicker and smoother to play, as well as tactical changes and match reports being faster than ever before.

The gripping storyline foreshadows the events that will take place in the Forgotten Realms with the coming of release this June of the Fourth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game.
In the aftermath of the defeat of the King of Shadows, the Sword Coast is in the midst of an uneasy economic recovery. Trade syndicates have sprung up to exploit the post-war confusion for their own ends. The player’s party will wade into this uncertain environment; in order to increase their own fortunes, they can either ally with a syndicate to create a trade empire, or cut their own path through Faerûn by preying upon caravans and selling the goods on the black market. As they attempt to extend their influence, players will become aware of a new faction working behind the scenes: the evil, shapeshifting, serpentine Yuan-Ti.
In addition to trading and economic manipulation, the Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir Overland Map allows players to explore the Chultan Peninsula and Sword Coast in a non-linear manner never before seen in any of the Neverwinter Nights games. Exploration will take players from well-known locations, like Neverwinter and Crossroad Keep, to more exotic areas, such as the xenophobic jungle nation of Samarach. Groups of highwaymen and monsters populate the Overland Map and the farther from civilization the player roams, the more difficult the encounters become. The 15-hour campaign in Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir is also packed with new classes, spells, creatures, and playable races.
Fans of the compelling multiplayer features of Neverwinter Nights 2 will also be able to take advantage of new improvements to the multiplayer experience, while modders will be able to take advantage of the power and flexibility of the Overland Map and Trading System features along with other world-building enhancements.

Travel the Sword Coast and Samarach using the open ended exploration of the new Overland Map.  Use skills like Spot and Survival while on the Overland Map to avoid ambushes and even find hidden locales and lost artifacts.
Create your own full party of adventurers. Devastate your foes with a squad of fireball-flinging Sorcerers, form a solid wall of steel with a party of Fighters, or strike the perfect balance in your party by spreading out the classes you choose for your characters.
Improved party gameplay including streamlined party conversations, a new Teamwork Benefit System, and powerful party feats.
The world's economy reacts to your adventures and choices. And, through trading and quests, you can expand your merchant company into a massive trading empire.

As a newcomer to Opulencia, you will get to know your greedy neighbors quickly as they will like nothing more than take all that you have. Everyone’s out to have the nicest castle…at any cost, so you’ll quickly learn the ropes on what it takes to be the richest and most envied hero of the land!
Looting
In Opulencia, looting is what makes the world go round. If you’re not spending your every waking moment obsessed with the size of your treasure pile, then your neighbors will think something’s very wrong with you. At the center of every castle lies its crowning jewel, the overflowing treasure room.
Defense
Start by creating the perfect castle layout, using the tons of available room combinations (it’s a lot, we did the math). Next, you’ll want to fill your new creation with hordes of loyal minions, ranging from fuzzy baby spiders to kill-crazy giant Cyclopses (or is it Cyclopi?). Don’t forget to liberally apply a healthy dose of devious traps to achieve that extra layer of deadliness.

The game is inspired by popular pulp fiction stories set during World War II, and delves into the key events and characters behind historic battles. Its scenario tells of a shady third party pulling the strings to orchestrate the war, using futuristic technology to advance the carnage for their own ends. Players compete in both turn based and also real time strategy battles, plotting moves and attacks in the turn based section and getting hands on by switching to the real time combat mode where they’ll be in charge of firing and reloading the weapons. The emphasis is not on trying to blast everything that moves however, as the player will often leave their vessels exposed and in significant danger. Keeping the right ships afloat is key, as the player will need certain craft to enable to them gain new bases and increase their fleet and others, like Submarines, to take out the heavyweight attack carriers of your enemy. As you would expect with a game of this nature, it’s perfect for two-player action and the wireless connections of both machines enables friends to compete against each other. With 20 single player missions to take on and the option to customise the player’s own flagship, there’s plenty to get stuck into.

This Is the Police is a strategy/adventure game set in a city spiraling the drain. You’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg as gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd (portrayed by Jon St. John, the voice of Duke Nukem).
Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigues. You are taking the role of Police Chief Jack Boyd – you’ll come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack see his retirement with a nice sum of money waiting to be spend or will he end up broken … or even worse?
Immerse yourself in a controversial tale of corruption, crime, and political intrigue. Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.
Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you’ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg’s crime bosses. Sometimes you’ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg? Or will you land yourself behind bars — or worse?











Your mission is clear: Make 500.000$ in 180 days, before Jack Boyd goes to retirement. How? Up to you!
Decisions, decisions, decisions – This Is the Police is all about a dark story and how you react to it. Whatever you decide, it will influence your game – and the fate of Jack Boyd.
The Good, the Bad … the Ugly? The Chief of Freeburg’s Police Department is dealing with all kind of people. It is up to you, to sort out the bad boys.
Follow your duties: As head of Freeburg PD, Jack has to take care of the daily routine – responding to emergencies, managing his officers, fighting for budget …
Start and solve Investigations and get evidence against the criminal gangs in Freeburg.
Deal with the different powers of the city: The Mayor, the Mafia, the Church, the Labor Union: everyone offers you a favor, but everything has its price …
Rich and fully voice acted story: Jack Boyd is portrayed by the glorious Jon St. John (aka the voice of Duke Nukem)
